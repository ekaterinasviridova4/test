{"input": "[ 47 % of all jobs are at risk of being automated] ( http: //motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-rich-and-their-robots-are-about-to-make-half-the-worlds-jobs-disappear). This number will grow grow until the vast majority of people become obsolete for jobs. Since some of this automation will inevitably come to weapons, the wealthy will have the perfect opportunity to commit genocide on the 99 %. By fortifying themselves in their gated communities with rows upon rows of automated defences, all unburdened by humans with consciences and families, they can simply wait for everyone to starve or get killed while they bask in their machine generated wealth. Once everyone is dead, they can simply be wiped from history. You, me, everyone will have never existed. A crime completely erased. Throughout history, people tend to use their wealth to show off how much wealth they have. The status symbols change over time, but the existence of status symbols does n't. There was a time, say in the 18th century, where the elite would wear quite elaborate clothing. Check out this picture of [ Louis XIV] ( http: //www.paradoxplace.com/Photo % 20Pages/France/FranceHistory/Images/Louis-XIV-BAR800.jpg). He 's dressing in elaborate, fantastical clothing to tell everyone, `` look how rich and powerful I am. I can afford to waste resources on immense amounts of expensive fabric. '' Nowadays, you would never see a wealthy leader dressing like this. Clothes have become cheap, thus they are no longer useful as a status symbol. Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth, but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart. His suit is just higher quality and better fitted. Or consider beauty standards. Back during the Victorian Era, it was very fashionable for women of class to have extremely pale skin. When most of the populace lived on farms or walked to work in a factory, most people got tan quite easily. Only the rich could afford to be pale. Nowadays, where most people work office jobs, retail jobs, food service, etc, tanning is a luxury good, a sign you have enough spare time to sit in the sun or money to go to a tanning salon. So, what would the luxury goods be for a post-scarcity society? In such a society, the cost of most physical goods would approach zero. Raw materials would be extracted by robots. Energy would come from cheap robot-produced solar farms. Robots would assemble and repair other robots. The cost of most physical goods, in a true post-scarcity society, is near zero. Sure, a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a 2015 Lexus, but what 's the point? Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIV 's outfit, but no one ever does. It 's just seen as silly and ridiculous, possibly even a sign of mental illness. So, what would rich people spend their money on? What are the status goods of post-scarcity society? Well, real estate could certainly be one. The cost to build a house may be zero, but land certainly is n't. Still, this can be ameliorated by high-rises. Lots of people can afford to live in a ritzy downtown area if a high-quality high rise can be built to next for nothing. Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their would n't. So, without that, what do we have? About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is human-intensive services. Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor? Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead. You *could* put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you 're better than that. Hire an expensive private tutor instead. You *could* have a robot do your hair or nails, but really? What are you, a common peasant? Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth. You *could* use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy. In short, in a world where the cost of physical goods is near zero, the only way to show off your wealth is to hire a bunch of people as a status symbol.

You 're already taking a good bit time to play the game You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore. unfit to fairly criticize the series I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard 's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material. Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 did n't live up to the hype It 's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. it 's a complete waste of the player 's time going about it that way. there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies. if the material is in the game, it 's there for a purpose. It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories. I did do the completionist run! I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not. It went - well, okay, I guess. However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches. I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. And so I made the world 's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard It 's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard taken with ME3 's ending, I think it makes for a far better story A renegade lady who was n't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests ( and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops). Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. when you play a character who 's a lot more of an asshole but who 's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it 's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary ( when you, the player, know that they are n't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience. It 's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'. They 're not hollow at all, they 're fantastic. The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could 've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*. The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead. Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it did n't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that 's your ending for you. Shitty failure Shepard 's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she 'd burned and destroyed anything else around her To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I 'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it. Every other *possible* ending that could 've been, she 'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions. Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences. the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that 's screwed up the whole way I do n't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it 's whatever Shepard I 'm playing in that particular runthrough that 's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard. The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'. The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied. For me, that was n't a completionist run. The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that 's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself.", "output": "<Claim> So here 's the brunt of my CMV: If you let any one of your squadmates die, ( unless their deaths are unavoidable </Claim> <Claim> a.) incompetent </Claim> <Premise> It 's really not that difficult with a little common sense!

Personally, I think it 's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it 's story telling. The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.

{"input": "I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. What you 're really seeming to say is that any action which garners attention is morally corrupt. You 've drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention can not also be done for empowerment, which I find to be the crux of your dilemma. If someone is confident in their body, is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position? The definition of empowering is to `` make ( someone) stronger and more confident ''. If the feedback about their bodies does that, then so be it. People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open. We share so much and censor so much less ... but why is this necessarily a bad thing? If no harm is done, what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange? Like it or not, the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor 'celebrity', with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers. If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her, so be it. It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that 's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment. I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet. I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone 's character. Like I said, I have no *problem* with anyone posting nudes, I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention. There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior. Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering? What about that makes someone feel good? When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have. I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people 's eyes if I ca n't justify a logical reason to do it. I just do n't see any reason in this type of behavior. Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn. The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions. Hence, my seeking of others opinions. And yet this is just the interplay of societal values. Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art. Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form, and this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our `` meaning '' in the universe. Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man ... certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well. What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent? What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity? Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as `` whoring ''? Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things, the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of `` Great Awakening '' where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin. Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex. In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we 're more lenient on violence than sex. The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public. This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex. There 's this mystique and taboos surrounding it 's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense. Even you 've admitted you ca n't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*.

Why ca n't I be friends with girls ( even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I do n't try to advance some romantic agenda? Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them? I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding because I want to know what older, more mature people think It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy 's school for the majority of my life. I feel like the interplay between men and women is always ( at least always initially) a bs game the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me I ca n't stand it this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian there are many people who want close relationships without romance an obvious example would be asexual people They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage how would you even quantify that How can you even compare them? What about the relationship of a brother and sister? limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women maybe you 're right who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple? people are different from you relationships are hard to compare Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.

After he points it at you? After he starts shooting? You 're carrying you just picked your brand new car up from the dealer while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car You lose your temper and get out of your brand new car yelling up a storm. You notice after a bit of yelling that the guy is carrying he has observed that you are as well and is scared Do you wait until you 're sure he has decided to use his firearm to act? do you act first because by the time you 're sure he is going to draw his firearm, you wo n't have time to act before he shoots you? The only reason this stuff does n't happen all the time is because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed. As soon as it becomes a reasonable assumption, immediately escalating a conflict to deadly force starts being the best option. I 've worked in customer service and have been yelled at by strangers more often than anyone should have. If I lived in a society where most people were carrying firearms, I would have had to ask myself `` Is this person angry enough to kill me? because if I wait to find out for sure I 'll already be dead '' way more often than I 'd like. I do n't think this decision changes if you are comfortable killing for money you kill for money if you can get away with it When he starts to pulling out a gun you try to get cover when he starts aiming at you you draw to fire The known rule would be only to draw gun to shoot and who is aiming at you is aiming at you to shoot you are in right to defend yourself If you are unsure of someone 's intentions you should get cover as soon he notices that and does n't intend to kill you he should make this well known to you he does n't you to shoot him either You 'd likely be dead in scenarios 2 and 3. This is n't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something. By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one. There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn. That shit happens fast, and reactive speed is n't fast enough. once you remove the non-lethal option, the lethal one gets a lot more comfortable Yes I do n't see how you intend to CMV with the scenarios 2 and 3 I do n't see them as very likely as nobody is going to draw a concealed gun when not intending to kill. I would expect the effect would be that the still thinking criminals would change to some other safer crime their chances of getting shot would also increase It would still be illegal to kill a robber I do n't think some of them would start killing thus being legal to kill in defense Of course you intend to kill the person if you draw your weapon, if you can reasonably assume that they have a weapon, you ca n't wait for them to draw theirs before you decide to defend yourself if you want to leave alive All you know in all three scenarios is that someone you are in conflict with probably has a gun and there is a significant chance they will use it. If you do n't have reasonable cause to believe someone is armed because very few people have CCWs then things like letting the guy you just rear ended blow off steam becomes a reasonable option because he likely ca n't kill you within in a few seconds If 1 in 5 people can kill you in seconds being impolite gets deadly very quickly.

{"input": "The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan / vegetarian diet are slim to none Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare. My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. this practice would be much easier to `` evangelize '' than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it, meat is tasty ( and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience) Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare they likely do want to improve animal welfare As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare. People will always want meat and the market will always provide it. Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves.

{"input": "I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It 's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries the far-left has for the most part been dealt with However the far-right continues to be a menace. I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes a handful of people make the world a much nastier place Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. Unfortunately with the world 's obsession with free speech and personal liberty such leaders are given a free hand Would n't restricting `` free speech '' put brakes on this sort of recruitment? Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism. I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just is n't enough their will always be a few bad apples These bad apples need to be weeded out Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society. The only constant is change. Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts. The supports necessary for real stability simply do n't exist. To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations. Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We Claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up. With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed. Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current. Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual. Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye. This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected. It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this. Finally it gives them a true Claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group. Good arguments Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous. do n't you think it 's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook Should't this sort of thing be stopped? While this may be true, has n't the killing of innocents ( and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral ( outside of wars)?

{"input": "There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO / partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical / sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through. There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that `` sex with another person = relationship over '' that I do n't think hold up. Sex is the most important part of a relationship, and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this is n't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes / issues together. Cheaters will always cheat again, so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases other than anecdotal evidence, I have n't seen anything to support this Claim. Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that 's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat. Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and / or the relationship is too far gone / unsalvageable and / or this is the straw the broke the camel 's back etc. Cheating should n't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. I' l begin by saying it has never happened to me you make some good points. To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage. even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship. Like trust. Loyalty. Companionship. You are correct that this is false. However, cheating on a spouse is *pretty big mistake*. Cheating, as I define it, is a choice. A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage. You are correct that this is false. However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat. Yes. But `` talking about the problem '' is an ideal situation. It often does n't work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern ... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong. is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship is an indication that such a thing will happen again is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship Are there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? I 'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances. I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. In my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner is n't fulfilling all of his / her obligations ( i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his / hers? Why should you stay married? It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. It 's an ethical question everyone has their different values it 's impossible to prove definitively what you should / should not do. It 's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations. It 's a choice. But if you do n't break up, you are stuck with a person who does n't value you enough to stay loyal. Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship? Things need change.

I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes a handful of people make the world a much nastier place Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. Unfortunately with the world 's obsession with free speech and personal liberty such leaders are given a free hand Would n't restricting `` free speech '' put brakes on this sort of recruitment? Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.

Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism their poison should be kept out of the minds of children Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination. it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem. The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough. this is obviously extreme you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe is n't really all that subjective. Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.

{"input": "This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men did n't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me it seriously strains credulity to begin with Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace there 's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels Joseph probably would have made that barn the family 's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men had n't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt why did they stay so long anyway?

She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls the only people available to sell to are the workers, who 's total funds are £500 No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.

{"input": "There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973 Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around Its a complicated issue Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons surely its a significant number how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point * Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country Modern technology like the internet must be considered One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as `` useful '' is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock The attitude of human value as `` what they [ potentially] contributed to me / Exxon Mobile '' is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit. It 's the same problem with war Once killing foreigners is an acceptable / inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it Other countries also build militaries to do so and to `` defend '' against each other its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do everybody 's doing it and so must do it It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries This works on the inverse too When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed You 'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today the `` religions of the book '' may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers now it 's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves The Zeitgeist changes, as people 's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization in reality, everything is true / untrue depending on it 's level of resolution or accuracy children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around they 're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the `` efficient '' cattle model Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of `` product '' to be `` thrown away '' and that seen as okay the worst thing is not that the Zeitgeist within society that people should be `` grown '', and graded, and that these categories are accurate Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did it 's `` true '' or not and that `` truth '' is available to us in an absolute way that smart people are cooperative Political parties appeal to these learned biases The general attitude among the adult population is `` do n't think too much '' it 's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing you 're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a `` better place '' is that come with it Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal only that benefits would exist and it 's our job to weigh those against the costs always If you can not see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively You 're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome This America faced a sustainable growth rate Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces Babies were created indiscriminately The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970 Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue Everything is polluted to hell The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse The perception of the value of human life goes to zero I am in no way Claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal / illegal abortion My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said Your Claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life That is true such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations I believe you are in agreement with that you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration This is where we disagree. I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat I also do n't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the `` do n't think too much '' mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist Claims you 're making If the quality of life is higher, you 'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they 'd like If the quality of life is lower, you 'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [ how many other X-factors might exist,] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2rj2bt/50ofnigeriensareunder14yearsoldin/cngsdvf) and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism ( no offense) I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder I 'm telling you this because you 're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are having them challenge you and show disgust Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they 're antisocial, even when they 're around people they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view the stupid and shallow Premises would remain untouched You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective the reason people are highly sensitive [ emotionally] is the same reason you 'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor you 're concerned you 'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it 's [ almost never because they 're on a higher tier of information or understanding because they do n't even know that they do n't know In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they 've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance It 's why we recruit teens into the military They 're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences you did n't anticipate it, but thought you did, did n't you You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style You probably do n't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style This is the problem with X-factors and complexity You do n't know what you do n't know, you did n't know you did n't know my motivation, and you do n't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences the consequences are extremely negative for your generation i 'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you 're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself I do n't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent I have not said a single thing in this thread that i 've been absolutely sure of Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris It boils down to a well constructed shitpost *those abortions may have been a good thing? you can have that thought you are a retard! argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country? I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things! Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being*, and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself I like that. So personal; very theatrical Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it 's inferior without it being a big deal Did you expect people to *not* shoot holes in your reasoning I 'm pretty sure that 's how everybody 's mind works at all times that I said that you know that:) I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV To change your view, they inevitably have to think you 're wrong on some level of analysis Did n't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least Or did I do it too offensively well Teens are still developing, you know There 's [ plenty of research] ( http: //www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones) supporting that their minds are n't fully developed that they 're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it 's not And you can understand it, and do; which is why you 're pissed I did n't tell you to change your view because you 're inferior I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences ( which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah I think you 're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post 's shadow, and how you hate it Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things Yeah it 's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong There 's not a lot of sense in thinking things you do n't think are true Most folks do n't Claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them If you came up and said you hated black people I 'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too Not exactly humble beliefs, are they See, no emotional awareness My posts. Read them You do n't understand the signals you 're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them -- likely true information You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had, and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect It 's good that you 've distanced yourself from your view in saying you 're not that confident in it Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond It 'll go well with you to be smarter than that I think it 's working I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you 're wrong Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions It 's Dunning-Kruger Also your view did n't anticipate the human element an iota that was a lapse in emotion that revealed your age Once you learn what you do n't know, you will have made a dent in knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing In other words, it would n't be a drop in the ocean, so if you 're squeamish about being ignorant you should n't have been born, because everybody is ignorant of most things Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience because you 're going to readjust a lot Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be `` right '' sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good I would n't say you shot holes in my idea, more so that you used an unnecessary amount of time and effort to make a few simple points Most minds do n't work in such a way that they have to ignore information to function The Claim that one has to be emotionally retarded to have such a thought is ridiculous you seem to have been made mad by my comment and then put anger into the rest of your response Perhaps it is shallow it is the topic you set, no Of course, but that does n't mean that I have to agree with you when I see you as wrong I absolutely expected to be chewed alive for every fallacy I had What I was *annoyed* by were your unfounded and arrogant assumptions You Claim i 'm too underdeveloped to argue with, I should just accept your view, flush my brain of such thoughts, and continue about my day You truly are ridiculous I did n't tell you to change your view because you 're inferior I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences ( which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why Do n't try and punish me for talking to you That was the entire point of my CMV Did you not even read any of this? Did you not see the note that said that I was fishing for insight into the impact of 55 million abortions? You could have actually posed consequences to change my view And Christ, you said you *had the courtesy to explain this to me*. Kid ... Anyway, that 's why I gave that explanation, and you did n't anticipate it, but thought you did, did n't you? You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style You probably do n't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style ( 3) This is the problem with X-factors and complexity ( 4) You do n't know what you do n't know, you did n't know you did n't know my motivation, and you do n't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing ( The point of the thread, no?), or what interests were operating in the establishment of them ( The point of the thread, no?), or the consequences ( The point of the thread, no?) So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation ( heck of a statement without an argument behind it) A little self important eh? You seem to be quasi-psychotic Rambling on First of all, your comments, under your own description of the Dunning Krueger effect, have some serious ass Dunning Krueger I had reasoning behind my views, and was confident about the reasoning came here in expectance that there was some reasoning that I had not yet considered which may change my opinion I came here to learn I came here expecting myself to be proven wrong You certainly were n't close to proving anything Having a thought, however morbid and efficient, is not enough to indicate a lack of emotional intelligence People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views Then you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior Really, were you home-schooled Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that was n't weened until the age of 15 You also have special snowflake syndrome All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i 'll trust how very *smart* you sound I 'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct? This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion Also, your `` Harvard studies, read them '' was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion 600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought. I 'm not going to *abandon* a view, i 'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind. Then why is this post so popular? Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you 're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea Visit the subreddit /r/iamverysmart to see your error You 're one of those people you imply?

{"input": "I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups. For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists. my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people do n't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims do n't want to stone non believers. This is like saying `` Guns do n't kill people, people kill people. '' This might be true the gun certainty played a big part. Okay, but even if religion did motivate people to kill, it does n't provide the means to kill, only the motivation.

{"input": "Intelligence is at least partially genetic therefore passed down by parents I 'm against killing. For example, we could use the IQ scale ( for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to. Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that 's the number of offspring you 're allowed to create. So someone with near average intelligence ( near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children ( not each.) and sustain their population. Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children ... and so on. This would eventually make the human race smarter therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.

{"input": "The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan / vegetarian diet are slim to none Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare.

{"input": "I 'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right, they are extremely overhyped One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games. Another reason for my opinion is that CoD does n't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre. There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it 's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre. numbers do n't lie. With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that are n't a fan of. Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now, you 're an executive of Activision-Blizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, `` for change 's sake. ``? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model they 've had, you 're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I 'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. Really, your view of `` overrated and overhyped '' is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc. I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD? It makes no sense. The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time ( and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely would n't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They are n't a charity, so gamers are n't entitled to it. And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb. However, this in itself is n't why I think the games are overrated. Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin 's Creed, or Pokemon. The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield. It really does n't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own, each game feeds off the success of its predecessor. It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is. Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out. When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success. It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre. One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it. Brought it to the mainstream. It 's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model. Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression. It 's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD 's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success. To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar. When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it 's not fair to say WoW is overrated. It 's iconic in its genre. It 's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed.

Given CoD 's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success. </Premise> <Premise> To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar. </Premise> <Premise> When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it 's not fair to say WoW is overrated. </Premise> <Premise> It 's iconic in its genre. </Premise> <Claim> It 's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed. </Claim> <Claim> I feel that your view is n't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated. </Claim>"}

I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding because I want to know what older, more mature people think It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy 's school for the majority of my life. I feel like the interplay between men and women is always ( at least always initially) a bs game the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me I ca n't stand it the fact that most people are n't interested in romance with family members of the opposite sex women and men do interact in a romantic way, one trying to impress the other to get involved in romance There are a lot of great, good-looking people out there. Jeez, my college is known for being the land of partying, gorgeous college people. But romance just is n't as cut and dry as that. The one thing I 've learned about life and romance going through high school and college? There is no manual. None. And we try to define all of these interactions between the sexes as one thing or another because it 's easy. But it really isn't. I can think a girl is absolutely gorgeous and still be friends with them, mostly because I do n't think she 's the one for me. That does n't devalue them, just because I do n't feel like I want to keep someone exclusively to myself does n't mean I care for them any less. And just trying to be romantic with women, assuming the endgoal of any compatible people is romance, completely cuts out some of the most beautiful times you can have with people. I 've spent countless all-nighters with a friend just shooting shit, due to insomnia and boredom. I 've held a friend so close after she told me I was the biggest reason she had n't killed herself. I 've watched stars fall on a hilltop so clear and beautiful as I called a friend a sister for the first time. So many interactions. So many beautiful, hard, wonderful, life-changing experiences I 've had because of friendships with women. And it 's no harder than being a friend with a guy, because we seem to forget so many times that women are people too, they are sad, happy, lonely and joyful at times, just like us. Sometimes you love a person without needing to hold them close to you. Experience that, I beg you. What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship does n't have to be romantic I wonder how you 've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.

{"input": "Like many American kids, I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in `` Monopoly '' games with my family. there is very little skill involved in playing the game it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once ~50 % of the board has been Claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another 's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them. While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going, because it would be `` unfair '' to keep going despite the likely outcome. If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance ( perhaps a redesign of the board more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better `` Chance '' cards even removal of the pieces entirely Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion. I have to ask because it 's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule ( where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder Another common one I grew up with was the `` Free Parking '' rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game. Assuming that you 're playing with auctions ( and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation. The game only becomes a drawn-out slugfest if players ca n't get monopolies which only happens if players do n't negotiate This is the soul of the game ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game If players A, B, C, and D are playing, and A is obviously ahead after a few go-arounds, should A just win? Of course not! B, C, and D should be conspiring like hell to take A down. B can `` not notice '' when C and D land on his properties, making A the only one to pay rent. C and D can agree to help each other complete monopolies and make trades of that nature. Once some players have monopolies, the other players have to either trade to make their own monopolies or get bled out quickly. Once monopolies ( and the corresponding houses and hotels) come into play, tiny rents become enormous and the game quickly comes to an end. Monopoly is drawn out because people do n't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players, a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end but it 's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill Only recently ( past 4 years) my family added money to the free parking though I always attempted to get the auction rule in I was always voted down Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game. Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with. If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun. It 's like playing poker with players who never bet it 's not fun, it 's just a long, awful slog That does n't make Poker a bad game by design even though it can be unfun in some scenarios it just means that it 's not a game that everyone will enjoy I 'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades. The most beneficial trade I 've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving `` immunity '' to that group. i.e. Alice has two Yellow properties and one Green property, while Bob has two Green properties and one Yellow property Alice agrees to trade her Green for Bob 's Yellow, giving them both monopolies, on the condition that Alice wo n't have to pay if she lands on a Green property and Bob wo n't have to pay if he lands on a Yellow property Players who do n't like trades tend to be nervous about giving other players a better position I find that they 're more inclined to do so if they feel it wo n't come back to bite them Seriously, immunity is great Even without auctions, making sure people are aware that they can be `` flexible '' about collecting rent makes the game go much faster. If you ca n't sell auctions, this should still help. Yeah, you 're right. Perhaps my family ( and quite a few other families) are just not equipped to play this game. It is probably akin to Diplomacy The family dynamic + the individual personalities of each player changes how the game goes", "output": "<Premise> Like many American kids, I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in `` Monopoly '' games with my family. </Premise> <Claim> there is very little skill involved in playing the game </Claim> <Premise> it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through </Premise> <Claim> Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. </Claim> <Premise> Once ~50 % of the board has been Claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another 's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. </Premise> <Premise> After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them. </Premise> <Claim> While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. </Claim> <Premise> One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. </Premise> <Premise> At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. </Premise> <Premise> Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. </Premise> <Premise> When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. </Premise> <Premise> But the game keeps going and going, because it would be `` unfair '' to keep going despite the likely outcome. </Premise> <Claim> If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance ( </Claim> <Premise> perhaps a redesign of the board </Premise> <Premise> more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better `` Chance '' cards </Premise> <Premise> even removal of the pieces entirely </Premise> <Premise> Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily </Premise> <Premise> As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion. </Premise> <Claim> I have to ask </Claim> <Premise> because it 's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer </Premise> <Premise> By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule ( </Premise> <Premise> where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder </Premise> <Premise> Another common one I grew up with was the `` Free Parking '' rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game. </Premise> <Claim> Assuming that you 're playing with auctions ( and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation. </Claim> <Premise> The game only becomes a drawn-out slugfest if players ca n't get monopolies </Premise> <Premise> which only happens if players do n't negotiate </Premise> <Premise> This is the soul of the game </Premise> <Premise> ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game </Premise> <Premise> If players A, B, C, and D are playing, and A is obviously ahead after a few go-arounds, should A just win?

{"input": "Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him. There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=rlQrYCacrKo I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself. I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I do n't think it would kill everybody, the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much. Society might collapse, lots of people may starve / die in struggle for survival, but extinction of a whole species seems highly unlikely. We 're not dependent on our technology to survive.

{"input": "As I understand it crudely explained in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour waste has to be produced in order for the system to function Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss. The boss owns the factory where the workers work they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500 Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each. She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls the only people available to sell to are the workers, who 's total funds are £500 No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit. This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit items that can not be sold must still be produced and thrown away. This is one of those views that likes to view production, capital, labor, and all of economics as a zero sum game. It 's not. Money circulates multiple times in a system value is created at each stage you 're simplifying it down to a level where it does n't show all of the uses of the money that actually happen I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity a single worker, who owns all of his own tools ( that he made himself), makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself The doll is worth $ 10. no one in this system actually has $ 10 no one can buy that doll it goes to waste it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone typically most companies are n't owned by the `` bosses '' They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things some of it is retained as capital by the owners what does that really mean? People do n't actually `` horde '' money in couches. They invest it in other productive stuff, such as new factories that produce *more* stuff ( someone has to pay the people that build the factories) money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses some businesses fail that is by and large where most of the `` surplus value '' is `` wasted '' only in a very narrow sense in the process of being `` wasted '', it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc. the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity. This is no different from any other system In communism, surplus value is also either created shortage occurs because not enough was produced The only difference is where the money goes real-world examples of communist states the money goes to the state `` wastes '' a lot of it in overhead and useless production in some kinds of communism it goes back to the workers factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen end up generating even more waste the people making the decisions about production do n't have as much incentive to get those decisions right", "output": "<Premise> As I understand it </Premise> <Premise> crudely explained </Premise> <Premise> in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour </Premise> <Claim> waste has to be produced in order for the system to function </Claim> <Premise> Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss. </Premise> <Premise> The boss owns the factory where the workers work </Premise> <Premise> they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy </Premise> <Premise> The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day </Premise> <Premise> At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500 </Premise> <Premise> Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each. </Premise> <Premise> She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls </Premise> <Premise> the only people available to sell to are the workers, who 's total funds are £500 </Premise> <Premise> No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls </Premise> <Premise> the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit. </Premise> <Premise> This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same </Premise> <Premise> each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit </Premise> <Claim> items that can not be sold must still be produced and thrown away. </Claim> <Claim> This is one of those views that likes to view production, capital, labor, and all of economics as a zero sum game. </Claim> <Claim> It 's not. </Claim> <Claim> Money circulates multiple times in a system </Claim> <Claim> value is created at each stage </Claim> <Claim> you 're simplifying it down to a level where it does n't show all of the uses of the money that actually happen </Claim> <Claim> I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity </Claim> <Premise> a single worker, who owns all of his own tools ( that he made himself), makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself </Premise> <Premise> The doll is worth $ 10. </Premise> <Premise> no one in this system actually has $ 10 </Premise> <Premise> no one can buy that doll </Premise> <Claim> it goes to waste </Claim> <Claim> it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown </Claim> <Claim> Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning </Claim> <Claim> The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong </Claim> <Claim> all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone </Claim> <Premise> typically most companies are n't owned by the `` bosses '' </Premise> <Premise> They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases </Premise> <Premise> The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things </Premise> <Premise> some of it is retained as capital by the owners </Premise> <Premise> what does that really mean?

{"input": "There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO / partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical / sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through. There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that `` sex with another person = relationship over '' that I do n't think hold up. Sex is the most important part of a relationship, and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this is n't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes / issues together. Cheaters will always cheat again, so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases other than anecdotal evidence, I have n't seen anything to support this Claim. Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.. My belief: if that 's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat. Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and / or the relationship is too far gone / unsalvageable and / or this is the straw the broke the camel 's back etc. Cheating should n't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. I do n't think this depends as much on the cheater as the person he / she cheated on. Some people are unable to stay with an unfaithful partner and should not be pressured into continuing a relationship after that point. Forgiveness depends on the forgiver, not the perpetrator.

{"input": "I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. It depends on the person. One person can be incredibly confident with his / her private parts. Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention. However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers. It 's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself ( endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos. The compliments feel great as well! In this sense, it is not done for attention. After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting? You 're also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos. People enjoy browsing other 's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own. It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos. Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking. I agree that people enjoy showing off is n't that stool a form of attention seeking? Being proud of something ( which in the case of nudes, like breast size, is sometimes uncontrollable and not something that one has to work for to attain that pride) is different than showing it off. I 'm proud of my own genitals but I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them. The difference I see is between pride and attention seeking behavior caused by pride. You so make a good point about the sexual energy. Of course, for those in relationships or some kind of monogamous partnership, I understand the sexual energy between sharing and receiving sexual images between each other. In the example of the monogamous partnership, I do not consider that type of behavior as being attention seeking or anything because it is meant to be between the two individuals for their own mutual sexual pleasure. The difference between that scenario ( which I think most people can agree with) and posting nudes online is that often someone will post an image and an unknown amount of people may see it and get pleasure from it. Nudes end up all over the internet and going into that situation, In anticipating this inevitability, are n't they then giving away they 're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from? I see that behavior as attention seeking what they get in return is the gratification of strangers admitting their nudity without the mutual respect in return. I do n't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity. For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous. They are not trying to get attention toward themselves superficially, but they 're instead attention seeking to just get the attention of others. Do you do this to seek attention from her? Or do you do it because it is empowering? It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it. Other people do n't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet. Some people even have partners and still do it. It 's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure. They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous. Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it. Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get. Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000. I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I 'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way I do n't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship. This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to. Like I 've said, is n't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others? It does n't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers. I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they 're purposely looking for attention they ca n't find within their immediate relationships. You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Just because you do n't find it empowering to post nudes, does n't mean other people wo n't. It 's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention. I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex ( impossible since I did n't live near them). I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well. Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it 's own set of motivations. I just do n't understand that you 're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just ca n't grasp it. The trouble I have is that I do n't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online. You 're right about the sexting thing the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous. Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often, so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes. Just as I do n't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists do n't understand how I *don't* find joy from it. Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I ca n't make an uninformed judgement about it. I am not going to tell that person that he / she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it ( the person may not even know either)! Thats very true. Applying it to my own life and what I personally do is a good way to assess not only this situation, but any situation in general.", "output": "<Claim> I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. </Claim> <Premise> I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. </Premise> <Claim> Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. </Claim> <Claim> Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. </Claim> <Claim> Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. </Claim> <Claim> Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life </Claim> <Premise> simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. </Premise> <Premise> I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. </Premise> <Premise> It depends on the person. </Premise> <Premise> One person can be incredibly confident with his / her private parts. </Premise> <Premise> Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention. </Premise> <Premise> However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers. </Premise> <Premise> It 's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself ( endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos. </Premise> <Premise> The compliments feel great as well! </Premise> <Claim> In this sense, it is not done for attention. </Claim> <Premise> After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting?

I work in a surgery unit the kind of gore I witness there does n't shock me at all I think a bit of desensitization can help keep a leveled head in stressful situations I 'm Unitarian Universalist Had a group of religions identical in all respects to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam developed in pretty much any area other than the middle east, they would be no more successful than any of the other relatively minor faiths out there today, depending on what the location in question actually was Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east 's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia and on the fertile crescent 's comparatively ancient status as a settled region a large part of this view came from something a history teacher told me 6 years ago: `` Geography Determines Destiny '', and that quote has stuck with me Christianity was primarily spread by the Roman empire But Rome already had a state religion before it adopted Christianity So the victory of Christianity over the Roman version of Hellenism ca n't be attributed to geography alone Likewise, Islam was hardly the first religion that Arabia had seen Its dominance there was not mere geography I 'm definitely intrigued by this, but not quite convinced enough to delta I might be able to go to `` The religion eventually adopted by the Roman empire had a very good chance of becoming globally dominant '' I think that 's still largely an accident of geography your post definitely did n't address my point A) about a hypothetical identical religion in a different location Geography certainly has to be part of it If Islam had arisen amongst the Moriori instead of in Arabia, I suspect we 'd have a largely Christian world I ca n't imagine missionaries travelling out of New Zealand having the same impact that the Arab armies did you ca n't blame geography for which religion became pre-eminent in Rome The emphasis on belief rather than practice For most religions, it matters what you do When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he did n't worship him? It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans It 's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily ( though that happened sometimes) It 's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they 'd want is a little Bible reading Well the native faiths do n't think reading the Bible is against their religion - they did n't emphasize belief the way Christians and Muslims do Education To a large extent, Judaism / Christianity / Islam were religions that demanded literacy This meant the teachers were also religious teachers Compare this to China, where literacy was n't tied to religion There may have been better literacy in China, but the smartest people ( or most avid readers anyway) were n't necessarily going into religion A whole lot of history is actually just individuals doing idiosyncratic things The right person in the right place at the right time Universalism Christianity was one of a very small number of religions that Claim a duty to proselytize and convert everyone Most religions, confronted with a different religion, just say `` this is true here and that 's true there '' or `` those are some deities we had n't known about '' or at worst `` those are some deities that are not ours '' Christianity really goes for the `` this is true for everyone for always, and we should actively work to spread it '' If Alexander the Great had that kind of religious zealotry, he could have spread Hellenism much more than he did he was satisfied with just adding himself to whatever pantheon the locals worshipped Well, you have successfully moved me from `` it 's probably about 80 % geography '' to `` it 's

{"input": "Intelligence is at least partially genetic therefore passed down by parents I 'm against killing. For example, we could use the IQ scale ( for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to. Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that 's the number of offspring you 're allowed to create. So someone with near average intelligence ( near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children ( not each.) and sustain their population. Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children ... and so on. This would eventually make the human race smarter therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. I know this would be a bitch to implement and it 's near impossible to actually do I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she ca n't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we 're not gon na kill one Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer ( almost 100 percent or something) takes off more ... Something like that. Much better than `` Kill off those with IQ less than 80 '' I would n't mind a smarter human race ... IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible It may also be important to note that your system is n't only difficult to implement like you point out, it 's also in direct conflict with how things actually work. More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated. There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc. Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test. This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80 ..... that would change nothing. The average IQ will still be measured in the same way the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same I mentioned that `` for want of better measure of intelligence '' I would love a better measure of intelligence. Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too ... ( http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoryofmultipleintelligences) Like a total of all of them. I 'm not proposing we implement it In a perfect world, sure. my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less `` less intelligent people '' ( and that would always be the case ...) I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test. I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is ( seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence better than SAT scores, right? And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for `` da murder '' if we were to take that route in the first place. instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever The `` number of mental retardation '' would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too, I do n't see your point there In total, everyone 's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter ... My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it. Separating intelligence into categories * is * a far better way to go about it by it 's very nature implies you can not sum them A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories. The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still do n't fully understand. It is also downright silly to consider it is n't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner. This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement. Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones. If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences ... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being ( weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy. if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever Eh, maybe we do n't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right? Just because we do n't understand every minute aspect of it does n't mean we ca n't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it. Well hopefully it would n't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you 'd be hurting future generation 's intelligence. You misinterpreted I would n't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all I used it as an example of an intelligence measure I meant most available as the `` most available / recognizable example of intelligence '' I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this. I think you are still oversimplifying it. no you ca n't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you can not feasibly do this. What if someone with a low intellect ( however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed? Also, only one of my parents finished high school. I am their 6th child. I have a Masters degree. See my user history for reference We do n't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing. I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest. The `` Yeah but what if ... '' thing just is n't going to fly. It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort. Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count. Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they do n't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount? I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population. I do n't think its feasible, though ... degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are We do n't know all we know some which should be enough to increase intelligence Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest ... I 'm sorry, maybe I should n't have posted this topic. I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good. Eugenics is not realistically feasible But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing Eugenics would work if eugenics worked. Which is basically like saying if unicorns were real, they would be real.
