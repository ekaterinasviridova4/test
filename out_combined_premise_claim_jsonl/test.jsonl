I used to follow option number 3, but recently started option number 1 in an attempt to line my actions up with my values. I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however I buy all my meat from local farms that I know have free-range chickens and cows that are grass-fed and well-treated until they are humanely slaughtered once the technology exists to 3D-print a chicken breast that tastes about as good as the real thing at an affordable price with 0 animal death, I eat that instead. I personally do n't see any distinction between my pet dog and a chicken. I had to take my cat to be euthanised at the vet I would never consider his throat being sliced by a machine as he hung upside down as humane treatment. Probably not even a bolt to the brain either. I agree that synthetic meat would be absolutely amazing though! I do see a distinction between a pet and livestock we domesticated those pet animals for the purpose of companionship in the case of the dog, a symbiotic relationship involving feeding them scraps for protection against predators that their scent can pick up easier than our sight, particularly at night bonded with them specifically because their utility functions are greater as companions than as meat Chickens simply are n't. Also, again, local farms and humane slaughtering, not factory farming. As far as I 'm aware, chickens at my local farm have their brains destroyed at the stem as quickly as possible while their head is chopped off. Gory, but painless, as the pain center is instantly destroyed. I would n't want to witness it I would accept that as a humane death ( as humane as we can make death, anyway) it has as little pain as we can deliver. a better way would be a proper Brompton Cocktail that would taint meat, and so is unfeasible here is the big problem I have It is literally impossible for me to live without other things dying. I wish it were n't so it is Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering their nervous system is sufficiently different from us we would n't know what we were looking for there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator 's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli. So, I do n't consider plants to be necessarily more moral. I find death by human to be more humane than death by any other cause that most game or livestock animals could hope for At the best chickens, pigs, deer, and cows would have their throats ripped out by weasels or wolves or whatever other predator. At best they 'd die slowly and painfully of some disease that they have no hope of overcoming, or slowly and painfully of starvation after breaking a leg and falling behind their herd Nature is not pretty we should be working to improve it I work best when I 've had more to eat than a salad future animals benefit more by my consumption of meat than they would if I was trying to go vegetarian / vegan I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals many of my pets are exotic and farm animals we have domesticated some animals does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins. Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop? If I were eating veggies, I 'd consume several plants I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce / day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake ( note: I do n't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal. A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten. A bolt to the brain sounds bad there is nothing past that instant No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life Ditto that for every other domestic food animal, and even animals that we hunt for food at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it I 'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on living on is better than just about any death I 'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for", "output": "<Claim> The options are as follows </Claim> <Claim> 1.

I think that most Jewish people do n't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims do n't want to stone non believers. Most branches of modern religions are n't inherently violent there are complex socio-political issues involving the ones that are e.g. how much of the violence perpetrated by Wahabist Islamists is based off of true religious fanaticism how much is caused by angry, politically disenfranchised young men who seek out an ideology that justifies their anger with America / the West that does not mean that a religion can not have violence as an integral part of it Vikings believed that the highest achievement and best place in the afterlife were gained by dying bravely in battle.

{"input": "Networking is discriminatory. A `` standard '' hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position and merits relevant to that position. Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions ( e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process ( `` jumping the line '') or to use some important person 's recommendation as additional clout for their application ( `` came very highly recommended by Bob '') is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities. I recognize and appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families and backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region / social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage. there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have ( being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias and may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair Businesses and societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social / economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications / character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer. `` Fix the process, not the game. '' `` this is how the world works, '' and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms I 'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is. But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated. Businesses are and should be designed to be effective. Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal. Any company / society which encourages business practices that are not effective will quickly be out-competed by one that is effective, and having effective businesses in a society in general improves the quality of life of the people living there. There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, I do n't think networking is one of them, Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc. Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which ( depending on the job) can often take months. If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire, that is an extremely bad thing for the business, which means that it 's extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires. The best way to do that is to hire people you 've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good.
