{"input": "Nativity scenes are antisemitic. This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities, it 's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn. The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents. Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men did n't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later. Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with. Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God. Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there 's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks. Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving. The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels. Joseph probably would have made that barn the family 's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men had n't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway? It 's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate. Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes. Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open.\" And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.\" When the wise men visited Jesus, it was in a house. The Nativity scene is about the visit of the shepherds, but the wise men are drawn into the manger scene early because it looks cooler that way. did the inventor of nativity scenes think it would\" look cooler\" because it portrays Joseph as a stereotypical Jewish cheapskate? Why change things from the biblical version of events? If the various artists who contributed to the scene had intended to make Joseph stereotypically Jewish, they would have. They 'd have given him a big hooked nose. They 'd have given him opulent dress while giving Mary or Jesus poorer dress. Something. But no: they do n't make Joseph look Jewish at all. If there 's anything anti-Semitic going on, it 's the near-erasure of Jesus / Mary / Joseph 's Jewishness. The artists are n't focusing on Joseph as a Jew; he 's an early Christian to them. As to why this conflation of two similar events? That 's a pretty common artistic trope. You say\" event X is like event Y, let 's put them together\". The visit of the shepherds and the visit of the kings are narratively redundant. It 's just cleaner storytelling to do the mashup.

{"input": "America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. Modern technology like the internet must be considered. Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. What are you talking about? Do you really think abortions are only had by incompetent people who could n't be good parents? This appears to be a belief that has led you to conclude that America must be better off but you are really misinformed about the type of women who obtain abortions. That may be true. My thinking was that abortions were mainly required by unfortunate people, who in turn from their difficult circumstances, would 've raised the child to be the same. Can you counter that? I have a [ source] that shows that abortions are typically ( and in some years, mostly) had by people without enough wealth to care for there kids. Sure, hopefully I can find some sources to support this argument as well, otherwise I may have to change my mind! ( Here is a well sourced link to some stats about women who have abortions) Some stats for example include\" 31 % of women obtaining abortions are in school 68 % of women who have abortions are employed. 33 % of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $ 11,000 annually, 11 % of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $ 50,000 or more. So that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $ 11,000 and $ 55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line. I ca n't confirm but I do recall reading once that a common reason for women to abort is becoming pregnant too soon after having a child. It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.

{"input": "People over the retirement age ( 62) should not be allowed to participate in politics. I 've noticed that nearly everyone in Washington is extremely old. I have always thought that that was a bad thing, because of a few reasons: 1. if you are already old, then the long-term consequences of your decisions probably wo n't happen until after you are gone, but will be horrible for all of us that are still around, 2. if you are already retired, then you would n't know what it is like for a working person today, especially someone struggling to live paycheck-to-paycheck. old people should n't be in politics because the consequences of their decisions wo n't affect them, and they do n't understand what the circumstances of today are. Some of your criticisms are definitely valid. However, older people often have more varied or extensive life experiences to draw on, and do not generally make decisions in a vacuum. For example, imagine a relatively long ( 30+ years) period of peace. All of a sudden, war is a possibility. I would like my decision-making body to have at least a few people who might have had prior experience with a war. Additionally, when you elect someone, like your senator, you 're not just electing them, you 're also electing their entire staff.

However, it 's not like the previous generation 's knowledge would have disappeared there are thousands of guides and essays about every topic. sure, but guides and essays are not necessarily the same as personal experience.

What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man 's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species. There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself. I do disagree with Gade a little bit.

Why is the end of our current economic paradigm not followed by a new one? The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm wo n't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing.

Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things, but once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. Yes food shortages would be difficult in a city but if it got that bad why would n't people just leave the city and form small communities that farmed their own food? Why would it be the end of man? What would be stopping them is the people already in the commutes they would try to go to. If the urban folk get rid of the rural folk the urban folk will just die due to their lack of skills.

{"input": "Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such. The DSM-IV defines delusion as: A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition and should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar\" kin.\" If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional and others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit. But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity. We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder. Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process ( which I believe you 've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well ( if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM). Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior. Take for instance being\" taken by the holy spirit\". From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us would n't describe them as\" delusional\" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they 've been practiced for centuries. While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there 's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier. I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.", "output": "<Explicit> Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such. </Explicit> <Explicit> The DSM-IV defines delusion as: A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. </Explicit> <Explicit> Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition and should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar\" kin.\" </Explicit> <Implicit> If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional and others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit. </Implicit> <Implicit> But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity. </Implicit> <Explicit> We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder. </Explicit> <Implicit> Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process ( which I believe you 've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well </Implicit> <Explicit> ( if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM). </Explicit> <Explicit> Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior. </Explicit> <Explicit> Take for instance being\" taken by the holy spirit\". </Explicit> <Implicit> From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior </Implicit> <Implicit> but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. </Implicit> <Explicit> As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. </Explicit> <Implicit> The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us would n't describe them as\" delusional\" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they 've been practiced for centuries. </Implicit> <Explicit> While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself </Explicit> <Implicit> in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there 's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier. </Implicit> <Explicit> I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being </Explicit> <Explicit> if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others. </Explicit>"}
