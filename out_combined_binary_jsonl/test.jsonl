I personally do n't see any distinction between my pet dog and a chicken. If I had to take my cat to be euthanised at the vet, I would never consider his throat being sliced by a machine as he hung upside down as humane treatment. Probably not even a bolt to the brain either. I agree that synthetic meat would be absolutely amazing though! I do see a distinction between a pet and livestock, namely that we domesticated those pet animals for the purpose of companionship ( and in the case of the dog, a symbiotic relationship involving feeding them scraps for protection against predators that their scent can pick up easier than our sight, particularly at night), and have bonded with them specifically because their utility functions are greater as companions than as meat. Chickens simply are n't. Also, again, local farms and humane slaughtering, not factory farming. As far as I 'm aware, chickens at my local farm have their brains destroyed at the stem as quickly as possible while their head is chopped off. Gory, but painless, as the pain center is instantly destroyed. And I would n't want to witness it, but I would accept that as a humane death ( as humane as we can make death, anyway), as it has as little pain as we can deliver. Admittedly, a better way would be a proper Brompton Cocktail, but that would taint meat, and so is unfeasible. Finally, here is the big problem I have: It is literally impossible for me to live without other things dying. I wish it were n't so, but it is. Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering, as their nervous system is sufficiently different from us that I believe we would n't know what we were looking for. However, there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator 's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses, and other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks ( which, further, will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics), which tells me that when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli. So, I do n't consider plants to be necessarily more moral. Further, I find death by human to be more humane than death by any other cause that most game or livestock animals could hope for. At the best, chickens, pigs, deer, and cows would have their throats ripped out by weasels or wolves or whatever other predator. At best they 'd die slowly and painfully of some disease that they have no hope of overcoming, or slowly and painfully of starvation after breaking a leg and falling behind their herd. Nature is not pretty, and we should be working to improve it. I work best when I 've had more to eat than a salad, so in the long run, future animals benefit more by my consumption of meat than they would if I was trying to go vegetarian / vegan. I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals because many of my pets are exotic and farm animals. The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins. Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop? In a day, I eat maybe 1/3 of a cow or 1/2 of a chicken if I 'm hungry. If I were eating veggies, I 'd consume several plants. I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce / day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake ( note: I do n't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal. The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins. On the contrary: A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten. A bolt to the brain sounds bad, but there is nothing past that instant. No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life. Ditto that for every other domestic food animal, and even animals that we hunt for food: at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it. I 'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on; in the general sense, living on is better than just about any death; I 'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for. I keep forgetting to add this, but I also think that quality of life is something that should be accounted for when debating this. How much does a cow need to fear predators when it 's under the watch of a farmer? keep in mind, my defense is for traditional-type farms, not the admittedly abhorrent factory farms, from which I do n't buy any meat Up until its last day, it is living essentially a cow vacation. Plenty of grass to eat, maybe the occasional milking but other than that, it 's generally less stressful ( assuming animals feel stress at all, which I 'm assuming you would believe if you believe animals can suffer, as stress is the basis for suffering) up until the very last second.

{"input": "Religion is not violent or not violent, its followers are. So recently I 've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion. I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups. For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists. So, my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people do n't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims do n't want to stone non believers. Most branches of modern religions are n't inherently violent, and there are complex socio-political issues involving the ones that are e.g. how much of the violence perpetrated by Wahabist Islamists is based off of true religious fanaticism, and how much is caused by angry, politically disenfranchised young men who seek out an ideology that justifies their anger with America / the West but that does not mean that a religion can not have violence as an integral part of it, and there are historical examples of this. Vikings believed that the highest achievement and best place in the afterlife were gained by dying bravely in battle. The Thuggee cult believed that the murder of innocents was necessary to appease Kali and prevent the destruction of the world. Aztecs required human sacrifice in their religious rituals. Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway but the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations. You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion but once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth. Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it 's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group. It 's hard enough to change a social norm of violence when it 's simply cultural, it 's even harder if people have been conditioned to believe that the norm is all that stands in the way of preventing the end of the world or is a persons only way into Valhalla. I think in those cases we can both say that the religion is inherently violent, and that even if culture helped start that norm it eventually becomes the religion that causes the actions. This is exactly the kind of explanation I was looking for. I 'm on mobile, but I 'll award you a delta when I get home. You 've appealed to all my sensibilities around this kind of issue while only making statements I agree with to change my view.

{"input": "America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. Modern technology like the internet must be considered. Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. Simply speaking, one person can set in motion drastic change for an entire nation. 55 million chances to do so is n't a bad place to start. If that was a good basis for having a huge population, India would be a superpower.

{"input": "Humans are going to die out because of an economic collapse. Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him. There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter / Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What 's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man 's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species. There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself. I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I do n't think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much. Praxagora: I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in common; there will no longer be either rich or poor; I shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Blepyrus: But who will till the soil? Praxagora: The ~~slaves~~ robots of course. Automation is a slow process that will take decades, and end up revolutionizing our economic structure and way of life.

{"input": "Networking for jobs behaves as a discriminatory mechanism to keep money; good jobs inside a particular social circle should be discouraged or eliminated as a criterion for employment. Networking is discriminatory. A\" standard\" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position and merits relevant to that position. Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions ( e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\" jumping the line\") or to use some important person 's recommendation as additional clout for their application (\" came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities. I recognize and appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families & backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region / social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have ( being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias and may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting. Businesses and societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social / economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications / character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.\" Fix the process, not the game.\" I understand\" this is how the world works,\" and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms. I would love to have this explained in a way that takes the above points into account & would allow a person to network without the valuation that it is a necessary evil. networking is a useful crutch in hiring because most hiring processes are fundamentally broken, but that does not make it fair, just, or desirable. * I 'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is. But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated. Businesses are and should be designed to be effective. Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal. Any company / society which encourages business practices that are not effective will quickly be out-competed by one that is effective having effective businesses in a society in general improves the quality of life of the people living there. There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I do n't think networking is one of them the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking. Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc. Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which ( depending on the job) can often take months. If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire, that is an extremely bad thing for the business, which means that it 's extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires. The best way to do that is to hire people you 've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good. Interviews are an extremely poor replacement actually working with someone, or for the opinion of a trusted colleague. Totally valid game theory, and well-articulated!
