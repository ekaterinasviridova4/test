{"input": "Nativity scenes are antisemitic. This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities, it 's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn. The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents. Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men did n't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later. Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with. Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God. Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there 's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks. Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving. The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels. Joseph probably would have made that barn the family 's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men had n't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway? It 's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate. Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes. Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open. Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time. In other words, events that happen at different points in the narrative are depicted as occuring side-by-side without consideration for *when* and *where* they actually happened. For instance, Jesus might be depicted as both a child and an adult in the same image. One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way, like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time. My point is, there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events, merely throwing together elements because they are related thematically or tangentially.

{"input": "I think the board game\" Monopoly\" is poorly designed. Like many American kids, I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in\" Monopoly\" games with my family. From what I can tell, there is very little skill involved in playing the game, it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.\" Monopoly\" was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George.^1 Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once ~50 % of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another 's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them. While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going, because it would be\" unfair\" to keep going despite the likely outcome. If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance ( perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better\" Chance\" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker ( Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion. First, are you actually playing monopoly according to the base rules? I have to ask because it 's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer. By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule ( where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder), which makes it take much longer for people to build up property, dragging out the early stages of the game. Another common one I grew up with was the\" Free Parking\" rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game. Assuming that you 're playing with auctions ( and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation. The game only becomes a drawn-out slugfest if players ca n't get monopolies, which only happens if players do n't negotiate. This is the soul of the game, and ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game. If players A, B, C, and D are playing, and A is obviously ahead after a few go-arounds, should A just win? Of course not! B, C, and D should be conspiring like hell to take A down. B can\" not notice\" when C and D land on his properties, making A the only one to pay rent. C and D can agree to help each other complete monopolies and make trades of that nature. Once some players have monopolies, the other players have to either trade to make their own monopolies or get bled out quickly. Once monopolies ( and the corresponding houses and hotels) come into play, tiny rents become enormous and the game quickly comes to an end. In short, Monopoly is drawn out because people do n't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game: monopolies. Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win, and the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players, a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice. A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end, but it 's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill. That is a possibility of have not considered actually. Only recently ( past 4 years) my family added money to the free parking though I always attempted to get the auction rule in I was always voted down. Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game. Alas, I have not actually played it in a while and I 'll play it with these rules before confirming the delta, for these rules may not be enough to convince me that the game is designed well. Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with. If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun. It 's like playing poker with players who never bet: it 's not fun, it 's just a long, awful slog. That does n't make Poker a bad game by design ( even though it can be unfun in some scenarios) it just means that it 's not a game that everyone will enjoy. I 'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades. The most beneficial trade I 've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving\" immunity\" to that group. i.e. Alice has two Yellow properties and one Green property, while Bob has two Green properties and one Yellow property. Alice agrees to trade her Green for Bob 's Yellow, giving them both monopolies, on the condition that Alice wo n't have to pay if she lands on a Green property and Bob wo n't have to pay if he lands on a Yellow property Players who do n't like trades tend to be nervous about giving other players a better position, and I find that they 're more inclined to do so if they feel it wo n't come back to bite them. Seriously, immunity is great. Even without auctions, making sure people are aware that they can be\" flexible\" about collecting rent makes the game go much faster. If you ca n't sell auctions, this should still help. Yeah, you 're right. Perhaps my family ( and quite a few other families) are just not equipped to play this game.

Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults. They will care about how people respond to them, but since it 's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity. Surrounding the entire site there 's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups. On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it 's taken as fact. It will reach conspiracy theory levels of\" proof\" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that 's uncovering something. Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person. I 'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative, but that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site. Thinking that you are unaffected by this does n't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you. It will certainly make you a colder person. Or let 's say, a\" less sensitive\" person. But I 'm not conviced that this is always a bad thing. After all the gore I witnessed on 4chan, I 'm able to jump in an accident scene and actually keep my cool while most other people around are freaking out like crazed apes, yelling and really doing nothing to help at all. After all the freak sexualities i was exposed to in 4chan, I find it hard to judge anyone about anything they do with their bodies and partners. And so on. I 'd say 4chan will open your eyes and show you Reality on many topics. It can have a bad influence with all the racism etc tho but this, you have to keep in check yourself. About\" pessimism\" .. well yeah ... some people may answer to you that there is not much to be optimistic about in this world and that maybe you are delusional / uninformed to think otherwise. Are they right? Are they wrong? Hard to tell. After all the gore I witnessed on 4chan, I 'm able to jump in an accident scene and actually keep my cool Is this something that has actually happened? Yes and no. a little girl was swept by a car in Paris, she was lying unconscious with a bit of blood from her nose, people were hysterical, I kept the mother in check cause she was trying to move her, then had to keep the people around in check cause they were physically trying to restrain her to prevent the mother to only touch her and she was getting totally mad ... All while calling the ER and taking a picture of the car 's licence plate cause the driver kept near his open door all the time ( while he was being harassed and yelled at by like 10 persons). I 've had no follow up on this incident. Just 2 weeks ago, heard and felt a crash very close to my house, a drunken teen had just smashed his car full force into another 's property wall after missing the turn, neighbors went out but no one had the head to keep the guy in check, cause he was walking near his ruined car, not understanding what just happened told him to stay put and sit and just generally speak to him so he does n't freak out. People were looking from a few meters, not doing anything.

{"input": "Humans are going to die out because of an economic collapse. Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him. There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter / Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What 's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man 's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species. There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself. I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I do n't think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much. you are forgetting the need to make money also wains, as unemployment rises it simply converts half the population to communism while the working class keep capitalism Is n't communism the reason why The USSR lost the cold war and North Korea a joke? partly, but communism in combination with capitalism has a different approach then pure communism one of the failures of communism was the lack of incentive with a part capitalism those with drive can still succeed, but everyone else will still have basic living tools, and i wo n't lie, people will see a reduction in what they are able to buy, but when you balance that out with perpetual unemployment its still better then the alternative.

{"input": "I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying. I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they can not depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists ( which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the\" not one of us\" ( pack) mentality and escalation of\" police state\". Let 's say you 're a drug addict and due to your addiction you ca n't hold down a job, are really strung out and resort to one of the stupidest ways to make $ 100 for your next fix which is mugging people on the street. Not getting the money is not an option because you 're desperate. If one in 10,000 people are carrying firearms, do you take your chances and try to get someone to hand over their cash without shooting someone or do you kill them outright and steal their valuables off their corpse? How does that decision change when the odds are 1 in 5? Remember, you 're an addict and not getting the money is not an option. You 're carrying and you rear end a guy. You pull over and the guy is really mad and he gets out of his car yelling up a storm. You know there is a 1 in 5 chance that the guy is carrying as well. When do you reach for your holster to draw your weapon and when do you fire it? 1. When he 's angry and yelling at you? 2. When he reaches into his jacket where his holster might be? 3. After you see the gun? 4. After he points it at you? 5. After he starts shooting? You 're carrying and you just picked your brand new car up from the dealer and while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car. You lose your temper and get out of your brand new car yelling up a storm. You notice after a bit of yelling that the guy is carrying and he has observed that you are as well and is scared. Do you wait until you 're sure he has decided to use his firearm to act? or do you act first because by the time you 're sure he is going to draw his firearm, you wo n't have time to act before he shoots you? The only reason this stuff does n't happen all the time is because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed. As soon as it becomes a reasonable assumption, immediately escalating a conflict to deadly force starts being the best option. I 've worked in customer service and have been yelled at by strangers more often than anyone should have. If I lived in a society where most people were carrying firearms, I would have had to ask myself\" Is this person angry enough to kill me? because if I wait to find out for sure I 'll already be dead\" way more often than I 'd like. Scenario 1: I do n't think this decision changes if you are comfortable killing for money you kill for money if you can get away with it. Scenario 2: When he starts to pulling out a gun you try to get cover, when he starts aiming at you you draw to fire. Scenario 3: The known rule would be only to draw gun to shoot and who is aiming at you is aiming at you to shoot so you are in right to defend yourself. If you are unsure of someone 's intentions you should get cover and as soon he notices that and does n't intend to kill you he should make this well known to you as he does n't you to shoot him either. You 'd likely be dead in scenarios 2 and 3. This is n't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something. By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds, and by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one. There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn. That shit happens fast, and reactive speed is n't fast enough. As for scenario 1, once you remove the non-lethal option, the lethal one gets a lot more comfortable. Yes, but I do n't see how you intend to CMV with the scenarios 2 and 3. I do n't see them as very likely as nobody is going to draw a concealed gun when not intending to kill. With scenario 1 I would expect the effect would be that the still thinking criminals would change to some other safer crime as their chances of getting shot would also increase. It would still be illegal to kill a robber so I do n't think some of them would start killing ( thus being legal to kill in defense). Of course you intend to kill the person if you draw your weapon, if you can reasonably assume that they have a weapon, you ca n't wait for them to draw theirs before you decide to defend yourself if you want to leave alive. All you know in all three scenarios is that someone you are in conflict with probably has a gun and there is a significant chance they will use it. If you do n't have reasonable cause to believe someone is armed because very few people have CCWs then things like letting the guy you just rear ended blow off steam becomes a reasonable option because he likely ca n't kill you within in a few seconds. If 1 in 5 people can kill you in seconds being impolite gets deadly very quickly.

{"input": "Religion is not violent or not violent, its followers are. So recently I 've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion. I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups. For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists. So, my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people do n't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims do n't want to stone non believers. Most branches of modern religions are n't inherently violent, and there are complex socio-political issues involving the ones that are e.g. how much of the violence perpetrated by Wahabist Islamists is based off of true religious fanaticism, and how much is caused by angry, politically disenfranchised young men who seek out an ideology that justifies their anger with America / the West but that does not mean that a religion can not have violence as an integral part of it, and there are historical examples of this. Vikings believed that the highest achievement and best place in the afterlife were gained by dying bravely in battle. The Thuggee cult believed that the murder of innocents was necessary to appease Kali and prevent the destruction of the world. Aztecs required human sacrifice in their religious rituals. Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway but the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations. You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion but once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth. Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it 's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group. It 's hard enough to change a social norm of violence when it 's simply cultural, it 's even harder if people have been conditioned to believe that the norm is all that stands in the way of preventing the end of the world or is a persons only way into Valhalla. I think in those cases we can both say that the religion is inherently violent, and that even if culture helped start that norm it eventually becomes the religion that causes the actions.

{"input": "Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system. As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function. Example: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss. The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy. The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day. At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500. Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each. She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls, but the only people available to sell to are the workers, who 's total funds are £500. No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit. This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that can not be sold must still be produced and thrown away. This is one of those views that likes to view production, capital, labor, and all of economics as a zero sum game. Money circulates multiple times in a system, and value is created at each stage. I.e. you 're simplifying it down to a level where it does n't show all of the uses of the money that actually happen. I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity: a single worker, who owns all of his own tools ( that he made himself), makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself. The doll is worth $ 10. But since no one in this system actually has $ 10, no one can buy that doll, and therefore it goes to waste. Do you see why this reasoning breaks down because it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown? Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning. The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong. In reality, all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone. One problem is that typically most companies are n't owned by the\" bosses\". They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases. The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things. Of perhaps some of it is retained as capital by the owners. But what does that really mean? People do n't actually\" horde\" money in couches. They invest it in other productive stuff, such as new factories that produce *more* stuff ( someone has to pay the people that build the factories), or money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses. Now, yes, some businesses fail, and that is by and large where most of the\" surplus value\" is\" wasted\". But only in a very narrow sense, because in the process of being\" wasted\", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc. Additionally, the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity. This is no different from any other system, BTW. In communism, surplus value is also either created or, alternately and more likely, a shortage occurs because not enough was produced. The only difference is where the money goes. In real-world examples of communist states, the money goes to the state, which\" wastes\" a lot of it in overhead and useless production as well. Or in some kinds of communism, it goes back to the workers. Another problem with your view is that factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place.

People do n't actually\" horde\" money in couches. </Explicit> <Explicit> They invest it in other productive stuff, such as new factories that produce *more* stuff ( someone has to pay the people that build the factories), or money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses. </Explicit> <Implicit> Now, yes, some businesses fail, and that is by and large where most of the\" surplus value\" is\" wasted\". </Implicit> <Implicit> But only in a very narrow sense, because in the process of being\" wasted\", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc. </Implicit> <Implicit> Additionally, the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity. </Implicit> <Explicit> This is no different from any other system, BTW. </Explicit> <Implicit> In communism, surplus value is also either created </Implicit> <Implicit> or, alternately and more likely, a shortage occurs because not enough was produced. </Implicit> <Explicit> The only difference is where the money goes. </Explicit> <Implicit> In real-world examples of communist states, the money goes to the state, which\" wastes\" a lot of it in overhead and useless production as well. </Implicit> <Explicit> Or in some kinds of communism, it goes back to the workers. </Explicit> <Implicit> Another problem with your view is that factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place. </Implicit> <Implicit> Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen, and as a practical matter end up generating even more waste, because the people making the decisions about production do n't have as much incentive to get those decisions right. </Implicit>"}

If I had to take my cat to be euthanised at the vet, I would never consider his throat being sliced by a machine as he hung upside down as humane treatment. Probably not even a bolt to the brain either. I agree that synthetic meat would be absolutely amazing though! I do see a distinction between a pet and livestock, namely that we domesticated those pet animals for the purpose of companionship ( and in the case of the dog, a symbiotic relationship involving feeding them scraps for protection against predators that their scent can pick up easier than our sight, particularly at night), and have bonded with them specifically because their utility functions are greater as companions than as meat. Chickens simply are n't. Also, again, local farms and humane slaughtering, not factory farming. As far as I 'm aware, chickens at my local farm have their brains destroyed at the stem as quickly as possible while their head is chopped off. Gory, but painless, as the pain center is instantly destroyed. And I would n't want to witness it, but I would accept that as a humane death ( as humane as we can make death, anyway), as it has as little pain as we can deliver. Admittedly, a better way would be a proper Brompton Cocktail, but that would taint meat, and so is unfeasible. Finally, here is the big problem I have: It is literally impossible for me to live without other things dying. I wish it were n't so, but it is. Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering, as their nervous system is sufficiently different from us that I believe we would n't know what we were looking for. However, there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator 's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses, and other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks ( which, further, will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics), which tells me that when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli. So, I do n't consider plants to be necessarily more moral. Further, I find death by human to be more humane than death by any other cause that most game or livestock animals could hope for. At the best, chickens, pigs, deer, and cows would have their throats ripped out by weasels or wolves or whatever other predator. At best they 'd die slowly and painfully of some disease that they have no hope of overcoming, or slowly and painfully of starvation after breaking a leg and falling behind their herd. Nature is not pretty, and we should be working to improve it. I work best when I 've had more to eat than a salad, so in the long run, future animals benefit more by my consumption of meat than they would if I was trying to go vegetarian / vegan. I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals because many of my pets are exotic and farm animals. The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins. Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop? In a day, I eat maybe 1/3 of a cow or 1/2 of a chicken if I 'm hungry. If I were eating veggies, I 'd consume several plants. I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce / day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake ( note: I do n't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal. The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins. On the contrary: A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten. A bolt to the brain sounds bad, but there is nothing past that instant. No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life.

{"input": "Networking for jobs behaves as a discriminatory mechanism to keep money; good jobs inside a particular social circle, should be discouraged or eliminated as a criterion for employment. Networking is discriminatory. A\" standard\" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position and merits relevant to that position. Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions ( e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\" jumping the line\") or to use some important person 's recommendation as additional clout for their application (\" came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities. I recognize and appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families & backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region / social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have ( being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias and may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting. Businesses and societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social / economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications / character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.\" Fix the process, not the game.\" I understand\" this is how the world works,\" and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms. I would love to have this explained in a way that takes the above points into account & would allow a person to network without the valuation that it is a necessary evil. networking is a useful crutch in hiring because most hiring processes are fundamentally broken, but that does not make it fair, just, or desirable. * I 'm a software engineer with an idea for a start up. But being an engineer, I just want to focus on the technology. I need someone to handle running the business side of things. I 've got a friend I 've worked with for years. Our different skills complement each other nicely, we have well established channels of communication, and I know she 'll be a great business manager or my start up. Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I enlist my friend? Six months into our start up, I ca n't handle the engineering work alone. My background is software, and there 's a hardware component that needs an experienced circuit designer. I know a guy who eats, sleeps, and breathes circuit design. We worked on several projects together in college, and I know I can trust him to get the job done quickly and do high quality work. Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I hire my old classmate? Now we 're looking to crowd fund the mass production of our product, and we need a good video for Kickstarter. My co-founder 's neighbor does video for an advertising firm, and we 've looked around enough to know that they 've offered us a competitive rate. Do we need to shop more of the market, or can we use my co-founder 's neighbor? As mass production kicks off, I put the circuit designer in charge of QA / QC for the produced units. He ca n't test enough units on his own. He could use an extra hand, but feels making a bad hire would be worse than doing it all himself. He 's got an old colleague that is experienced in hardware QA / QC, and happens to be available for six months. Can we hire the colleague who is a known quantity, or should we just punt on hiring anyone because it would be faster for the circuit designer to do it himself than go through a rigorous hiring process? At what point do your rules against networking kick in? I do n't think anyone would seriously suggest that someone looking to found a start up should have to dig through a pile of applicants to choose a co-founder. I would also hope that a start up 's first technical hire could be someone the founders have a reason to trust. And I see a line manager growing his team as a microcosm of a founder growing his company, though the company may have rules in place to help keep the line managers from going off the reservation. Do your rules only apply to big companies? If so, how big are we talking? Finally, do you apply the same rules to hiring out business services?

{"input": "Any given aspect of the legal system should be short and simple enough that an average high school graduate could fully memorize it. I 'm **not** saying simple enough that **all** high school students **should** memorize them; I 'm saying simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so. Like, most people do n't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet. But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.** I 'm not interested in hearing any arguments that are based in any way on what the laws are, right now, except by way of comparison. This includes the constitution. Seriously -- this is n't what I want to argue here, but I 'm 100 % on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents so appealing to the constitution is not on topic. I 'm not a fan of extreme simplification, but I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity. I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them. Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category 's laws. By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession ( medical, construction, IT, and so on). I 'd be fine with memorizing all the laws being a feat on par with memorizing the Bible; but it should be well within the average citizen 's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it. I am not arguing that a shorter legal code is by definition easy to understand. I am not arguing that the average High School student should be able to achieve a lawyer 's level of expertise in any given aspect. I 'm defending the memorization criterion as a way to limit the total length and vagueness of a set of laws. I entirely agree that certain parts are unnecessarily complex and complicated. I do n't think you 'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially. I 'll make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that, while it should be simplified, a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function. First, take criminal law. Let 's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad. That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad? Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad. But what if hitting them prevented some greater harm? Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system. That is n't to say that it would be better or worse than our 's currently, but given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it. Second, let 's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation. If you have n't heard of Dodd-Frank, well, lucky you. It 's a 800-odd page legislative titan. I would hardly believe it could n't be slimmed down some, yet a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal. Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading. That 's explicitly illegal now ( well, kind of ... not yet). There is n't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'. But who defines what excessive risk is? If you have a probability of default of 50 % is that bad? Is 15 % acceptable? What about 5 %? Even better, what about 4.99999 % versus 5 %? Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying\" Enough! We 'll agree on 5 % or we will agree to disagree.\" and to codify it. However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense. We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies ( or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler 's memory). In order to eliminate discrepancies, the system needs to codify at least some specific instances, and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond, well, *any* one person 's memory. thinking about it your post has made it obvious to me that the list of subcategories would be bigger than I initially anticipated, and might itself be a pretty significant feat of memorization.

{"input": "People who cheat on their spouses can and should, in some cases, be forgiven. There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO / partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical / sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through. There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that\" sex with another person = relationship over\" that I do n't think hold up. Sex is the most important part of a relationship, and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive. Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this is n't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes / issues together. Cheaters will always cheat again, so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I have n't seen anything to support this claim. But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually! Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that 's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat. sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and / or the relationship is too far gone / unsalvageable and / or this is the straw the broke the camel 's back etc. Cheating should n't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. I' l begin by saying it has never happened to me, and you make some good points. sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not the most important part. So it is one of the most important parts. To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage. even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship. Like trust. Loyalty. Companionship. Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. You are correct that this is false. However, cheating on a spouse is *pretty big mistake*. Cheating, as I define it, is a choice. A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage. Cheaters will always cheat again You are correct that this is false. However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat. Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that 's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem.\" talking about the problem\" is an ideal situation. It often does n't work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern ... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong. So, so far we can say cheating * is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship * is an indication that such a thing will happen again * is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship Are there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? I 'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances. I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. You have every reason to break up.. In my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner is n't fulfilling all of his / her obligations ( i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his / hers? Why should you stay married? It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. It 's an ethical question everyone has their different values so it 's impossible to prove definitively what you should / should not do. It 's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations. It 's a choice. But if you do n't break up, you are stuck with a person who does n't value you enough to stay loyal. Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship? Things need change. And the cheater is the source of the problem. Change the cheater by breaking up with him / her. marriage is a commitment.

{"input": "Me joining the army is not a waste of time nor does it conflict with my personality. I 've always had a respect for the men in uniform and I 've always wanted to join. Recently I 've disagreed with the practices of the U.S. military but that does n't mean that I hate the Warriors, just the people that force them into it. I 'm an immigrant and a Muslim neither of which is or should be a deterrent from joining. I want to be a doctor, not because of familial pressure but of a genuine need to help. So here 's where I am now: currently in first year of college studying biology, enough AP credits to be a tiny bit ahead of my classmates, an itching to explore this giant world God gave me I 'm also poor and medical school in the military ( from what I understand) pays for smart kids. Also, please forgive me if this is wrong or arrogant or whatever, I want the respect that people give men and women in the military. My plan was to graduate College and join the USHS ( the military medical school) and become and Army doctor. The only reservation that I had was that it would be a waste of my time because I want to be a neurosurgeon and that 's a looooooooong and rigorous path and that I might be losing precious time by joining the military. My mom does n't want me to join for that reason. Other things that I 've considered I love the idea of a brotherhood but I do n't agree with the ideology the military putting me through Med school will help me jump start life, I 'm very inexperienced and have n't seen much of the world and this I think will help me. My plan was to graduate College and join the USHS ( the military medical school) and become and Army doctor. FYI, you do n't have to go to USHS to be a military doctor. You can go to civilian medical school, and get HPSP which is slightly different but accomplishes roughly the same thing. The only reservation that I had was that it would be a waste of my time because I want to be a neurosurgeon and that 's a looooooooong and rigorous path and that I might be losing precious time by joining the military. Well, it 's not worth it for the money. You 'll lose money by taking HPSP and especially with USHS ( a longer commitment than HPSP). You 'll owe the military tons of time for the training, so you wo n't be able to enter civilian practice for years. Civilian neurosurgeons will easily catch up to their debtless peers in the military due to the huge difference in salaries. A civilian neurosurgeon can make over 400k easily. A military surgeon will never see that much. So, with NSRGY you will have a net loss in the military compared to a civilian path with loans. This is assuming you get a neurosurgery residency in the military, which is suspect. Neurosurgery is already competitive, and the military 's neurosurgery residencies are extremely limited. You may end up as a general surgeon, or doing several GMO tours before starting your 7 year neurosurgery residency. Other things that I 've considered: I love the idea of a brotherhood but I do n't agree with the ideology If you 're not all in with the military you 'll hate being a military doctor. The only reason to do HPSP or USHS is because you want to be a doctor in the military, not because you want the money. If you 're ambivalent the risk is too great.

{"input": "EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”. For those of you who do n’t know, it ’s common ( at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service. It seems that medical responders ( even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them. As for the “ They ’re not risking their lives for our country.\" argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests.

{"input": "Nativity scenes are antisemitic. This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities, it 's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn. The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents. Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men did n't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later. Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with. Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God. Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there 's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks. Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving. The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels. Joseph probably would have made that barn the family 's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men had n't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway? It 's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate. Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes. Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open.\" And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.\" When the wise men visited Jesus, it was in a house. The Nativity scene is about the visit of the shepherds, but the wise men are drawn into the manger scene early because it looks cooler that way. did the inventor of nativity scenes think it would\" look cooler\" because it portrays Joseph as a stereotypical Jewish cheapskate? Why change things from the biblical version of events? If the various artists who contributed to the scene had intended to make Joseph stereotypically Jewish, they would have. They 'd have given him a big hooked nose. They 'd have given him opulent dress while giving Mary or Jesus poorer dress. Something. But no: they do n't make Joseph look Jewish at all. If there 's anything anti-Semitic going on, it 's the near-erasure of Jesus / Mary / Joseph 's Jewishness. The artists are n't focusing on Joseph as a Jew; he 's an early Christian to them. As to why this conflation of two similar events? That 's a pretty common artistic trope. You say\" event X is like event Y, let 's put them together\". The visit of the shepherds and the visit of the kings are narratively redundant. It 's just cleaner storytelling to do the mashup.

I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies. I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love. The Brave Little Toaster is rated\" Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987. The reason it is does n't have attention now is because it did n't get attention back in the day. The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it. So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape. It was n't a made for TV movie, but that 's what ended up happening to it. It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view. Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it. So, in conclusion, The Brave Little Toaster is n't underrated as it is rated very highly but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements have n't aged well. Holy Crap I never knew it only went straight to VHS. That does explain a lot which kinda makes me sad it never got the loving from a massive portion of people like Iron Giant.

{"input": "Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such. The DSM-IV defines delusion as: A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition and should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar\" kin.\" If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional and others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit. But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity. We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder. Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process ( which I believe you 've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well ( if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM). Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior. Take for instance being\" taken by the holy spirit\". From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us would n't describe them as\" delusional\" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they 've been practiced for centuries. While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there 's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier. I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.", "output": "<Explicit> Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such. </Explicit> <Explicit> The DSM-IV defines delusion as: A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. </Explicit> <Explicit> Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition and should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar\" kin.\" </Explicit> <Implicit> If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional and others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit. </Implicit> <Implicit> But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity. </Implicit> <Explicit> We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder. </Explicit> <Implicit> Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process ( which I believe you 've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well </Implicit> <Explicit> ( if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM). </Explicit> <Explicit> Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior. </Explicit> <Explicit> Take for instance being\" taken by the holy spirit\". </Explicit> <Implicit> From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior </Implicit> <Implicit> but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. </Implicit> <Explicit> As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. </Explicit> <Implicit> The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us would n't describe them as\" delusional\" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they 've been practiced for centuries. </Implicit> <Explicit> While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself </Explicit> <Implicit> in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there 's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier. </Implicit> <Explicit> I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being </Explicit> <Explicit> if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others. </Explicit>"}
{"input": "The global dominance of the abrahamic faiths is largely an accident of geography. I was at a christmas eve service last night ( I 'm Unitarian Universalist) and one of the hymns the choir did there, describing the birth of Jesus had it occurred in a Huron ( Native American) community got me to thinking: Had a group of religions identical in all respects to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam developed in pretty much any area other than the middle east, they would be no more successful than any of the other relatively minor faiths out there today, depending on what the location in question actually was. Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant. I am not a trained historian, but it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east 's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia, and on the fertile crescent 's comparatively ancient status as a settled region. I 'd like to add that a large part of this view came from something a history teacher told me 6 years ago:\" Geography Determines Destiny\", and that quote has stuck with me. though I wo n't say my view has been reversed or anything, it has definitely been broadened. Christianity was primarily spread by the Roman empire. But Rome already had a state religion before it adopted Christianity. So the victory of Christianity over the Roman version of Hellenism ca n't be attributed to geography alone. Likewise, Islam was hardly the first religion that Arabia had seen. Its dominance there was not mere geography. I 'm definitely intrigued by this, but not quite convinced enough to delta. I might be able to go to\" The religion eventually adopted by the Roman empire had a very good chance of becoming globally dominant\" but I think that 's still largely an accident of geography and your post definitely did n't address my point about a hypothetical identical religion in a different location. Do you have any thoughts on, if not geography, why the abrahamic religions have become so widespread while other religions have not? Geography certainly has to be part of it. If Islam had arisen amongst the Moriori instead of in Arabia, I suspect we 'd have a largely Christian world. I ca n't imagine missionaries travelling out of New Zealand having the same impact that the Arab armies did. But you ca n't blame geography for which religion became pre-eminent in Rome. The emphasis on belief rather than practice. For most religions, it matters what you do. When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent. Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he did n't worship him? So that sort of gives Christianity a long term advantage: you can do what the encountered religion considers\" good\" but demand small concessions on belief. It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick. You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around. Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans. It 's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily ( though that happened sometimes). It 's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they 'd want is a little Bible reading. Well the native faiths do n't think reading the Bible is against their religion - they did n't emphasize belief the way Christians and Muslims do. Education. To a large extent, Judaism / Christianity / Islam were religions that demanded literacy. This meant the teachers were also religious teachers. Compare this to China, where literacy was n't tied to religion. There may have been better literacy in China, but the smartest people ( or most avid readers anyway) were n't necessarily going into religion. A whole lot of history is actually just individuals doing idiosyncratic things. The right person in the right place at the right time. Universalism. Christianity was one of a very small number of religions that claim a duty to proselytize and convert everyone. Most religions, confronted with a different religion, just say\" this is true here and that 's true there\" or\" those are some deities we had n't known about\" or at worst\" those are some deities that are not ours\". But Christianity really goes for the\" this is true for everyone for always, and we should actively work to spread it\". If Alexander the Great had that kind of religious zealotry, he could have spread Hellenism much more than he did. But he was satisfied with just adding himself to whatever pantheon the locals worshipped.

{"input": "Networking for jobs behaves as a discriminatory mechanism to keep money; good jobs inside a particular social circle should be discouraged or eliminated as a criterion for employment.

Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families & backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.

But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated. Businesses are and should be designed to be effective. Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal.

There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I do n't think networking is one of them the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking. Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc. Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which ( depending on the job) can often take months.

They will care about how people respond to them, but since it 's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity. Surrounding the entire site there 's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups. On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it 's taken as fact. It will reach conspiracy theory levels of\" proof\" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that 's uncovering something. Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.

To address your last question, yes, the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man.

{"input": "Patriotism is the belief that being born on one side of a line makes you better. American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people should not be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”. I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations.

{"input": "EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”. For those of you who do n’t know, it ’s common ( at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service. It seems that medical responders ( even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them. As for the “ They ’re not risking their lives for our country.\" argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests. Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but that ’s [ usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate. I ’m really hoping there ’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we ’ll see. It looks like there ’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually. In summary, I think that EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category but I now believe - for the same reason - that these discounts should n’t be offered at all. No they should not. Those people are civilians with full civil rights and in the case of police, are in a privileged position with regard to the law. Military personnel make substantial sacrifices and frequently live in poor conditions. While I disagree with the hero fetish that is popular these days, I understand and support discounts for military personnel. Also, note that EMS personnel are frequently employes of private corporations. I’m not sure how sacrificing rights makes them more deserving of such discounts.

{"input": "America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. Modern technology like the internet must be considered. Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. Simply speaking, one person can set in motion drastic change for an entire nation. 55 million chances to do so is n't a bad place to start. If that was a good basis for having a huge population, India would be a superpower.

{"input": "The Call of Duty franchise is extremely overrated and overhyped. I 'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right, though they are extremely overhyped. One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games. Another reason for my opinion is that CoD does n't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre. There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it 's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre. Let me address this by pointing one thing out: numbers do n't lie. With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that are n't a fan of. Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it. You 're entirely in your right to feel that CoD is overrated personally it seems futile to change this view. You like what you like. I can only provide objective points to maybe calibrate your perspective. So back to numbers do n't lie. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now, you 're an executive of Activision-Blizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series,\" for change 's sake.\"? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model they 've had, you 're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I 'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. Really, your view of\" overrated and overhyped\" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. The idiom,\" Do n't fix what is n't broken\" comes to mind. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc. I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD? It makes no sense. The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time ( and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely would n't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They are n't a charity, so gamers are n't entitled to it. Hmm ... I understand your point. And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb. However, this in itself is n't why I think the games are overrated. Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin 's Creed, or Pokemon. The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield. It really does n't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own, and each game feeds off the success of its predecessor. Then to that, the only thing I can offer is the historical context of CoD. It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is. Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out. When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success. It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre. One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it. Brought it to the mainstream. It 's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model. Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression. It 's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD 's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success. To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar. When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it 's not fair to say WoW is overrated. It 's iconic in its genre. It 's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed. Same with CoD. I feel that your view is n't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated.

And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb. </Explicit> <Explicit> However, this in itself is n't why I think the games are overrated. </Explicit> <Explicit> Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin 's Creed, or Pokemon. </Explicit> <Explicit> The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield. </Explicit> <Explicit> It really does n't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own, and each game feeds off the success of its predecessor. </Explicit> <Implicit> Then to that, the only thing I can offer is the historical context of CoD. It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is. </Implicit> <Implicit> Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out. </Implicit> <Explicit> When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success. </Explicit> <Implicit> It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre. </Implicit> <Explicit> One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it. Brought it to the mainstream. </Explicit> <Explicit> It 's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model. </Explicit> <Implicit> Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. </Explicit> <Explicit> Given CoD 's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success. </Explicit> <Implicit> To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar. </Implicit> <Implicit> When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it 's not fair to say WoW is overrated. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's iconic in its genre. </Explicit> <Explicit> It 's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed. </Explicit> <Explicit> Same with CoD. I feel that your view is n't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated. </Explicit> <Explicit> CoD was the progenitor for what we now know as the FPS genre, rather than a copycat with better graphics. </Explicit>"}
{"input": "Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare. 1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan / vegetarian diet are slim to none 1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products 2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand 3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. 4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. 4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However: 5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare. My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover, this practice would be much easier to\" evangelize\" than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it, meat is tasty and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare. although they likely do want to improve animal welfare Let me explain As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare. People will always want meat and the market will always provide it. Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves. You are correct on this point. So why do vegans decide to be vegans, if not to directly help animals? Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement.\" I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat.\" It 's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.

{"input": "Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering. Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend ( hence the throwaway), have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with\" it makes me feel good.\" Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either do n't have an answer or somehow say it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body. I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. So reddit, why do people post nudes? I seriously ca n't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle. What you 're really seeming to say is that any action which garners attention is morally corrupt. You 've drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention can not also be done for empowerment, which I find to be the crux of your dilemma. If someone is confident in their body, is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position? The definition of empowering is to\" make ( someone) stronger and more confident\". If the feedback about their bodies does that, then so be it. People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open. We share so much and censor so much less ... but why is this necessarily a bad thing? If no harm is done, what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange? Like it or not, the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor 'celebrity', with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers. If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her, so be it. It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that 's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment. I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet. I do not participate in most social media besides reddit, and even then I mostly lurk. Regardless, I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone 's character. Like I said, I have no *problem* with anyone posting nudes, I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention. There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior. Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways. Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering? What about that makes someone feel good? When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have. I understand that a lot of the issues I raise are personal opinions not shared by others which is why I asked in the first place. I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people 's eyes if I ca n't justify a logical reason to do it. I just do n't see any reason in this type of behavior. Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn. The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions. Hence, my seeking of others opinions. There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior. And yet this is just the interplay of societal values. Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art. Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our\" meaning\" in the universe. Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man ... but certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well. What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent? What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity? Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as\" whoring\"? Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things, but the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of\" Great Awakening\" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin. Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex. In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we 're more lenient on violence than sex. Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways. The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public. This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex. There 's this mystique and taboos surrounding it 's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense. Why? Even you 've admitted you ca n't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*.

{"input": "If a child struggles to achieve in grade school it is virtually always the parents' fault. For the sake of this thread, we 'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities; the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population. With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent ( s). A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting. I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child. maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below. I think parents are virtually 100 % responsible for producing scholastically successful children. I had parents who were extremely persistent about making sure i stayed on track. I was only recently diagnosed with adhd a reading disability and im 20 years old. I graduated on time but i struggled so much. I failed a bunch of stuff and was constantly embarrassed to show my grades to other people. I lost hope often because things felt hopeless, which lead teachers, doctors, family and other students to think i just didnt care. An issue is there are a ton of people with\" disabilities\" more so than you 'd think. Thats because we teach everyone to think the same way. Thats the issue. Im really good at doing certain things. For example, i can read, write, and even speak backwards pretty well. My brain is wired differently. I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant. It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid. THAT is the issue. Everyone has a mind that works in its own way. The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system. Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for\" dumb\" kids is the problem. Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids and thats because its not tapping into their mind right. If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus. I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant. It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid. THAT is the issue.

{"input": "Nativity scenes are antisemitic. This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities, it 's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn. The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents. Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men did n't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later. Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with. Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God. Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there 's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks. Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving. The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels. Joseph probably would have made that barn the family 's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men had n't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway? It 's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate. Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes.

{"input": "Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering. Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend ( hence the throwaway), have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with\" it makes me feel good.\" Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either do n't have an answer or somehow say it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body. I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. So reddit, why do people post nudes? I seriously ca n't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle. It depends on the person. One person can be incredibly confident with his / her private parts. Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention. However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers. It 's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself ( endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos. The compliments feel great as well! In this sense, it is not done for attention. After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting? You 're also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos. People enjoy browsing other 's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own. It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos. Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking. I agree that people enjoy showing off, in any context, but is n't that stool a form of attention seeking? Being proud of something ( which in the case of nudes, like breast size, is sometimes uncontrollable and not something that one has to work for to attain that pride) is different than showing it off. I 'm proud of my own genitals but I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them. The difference I see is between pride and attention seeking behavior caused by pride. You so make a good point about the sexual energy. I completely overlooked this part of the equation. Of course, for those in relationships or some kind of monogamous partnership, I understand the sexual energy between sharing and receiving sexual images between each other. In the example of the monogamous partnership, I do not consider that type of behavior as being attention seeking or anything because it is meant to be between the two individuals for their own mutual sexual pleasure. The difference between that scenario ( which I think most people can agree with) and posting nudes online is that often someone will post an image and an unknown amount of people may see it and get pleasure from it. Nudes end up all over the internet and going into that situation, a nudes-poster should anticipate this. In anticipating this inevitability, are n't they then giving away they 're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from? I see that behavior as attention seeking because what they get in return is the gratification of strangers admitting their nudity without the mutual respect in return. In regard to your comment anonymity, I do n't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity. For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous. They are not trying to get attention toward themselves superficially, but they 're instead attention seeking to just get the attention of others. I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them. So you want to show them off to your girlfriend so she will enjoy them. Do you do this to seek attention from her? Or do you do it because it is empowering? It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it. Other people do n't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet. Some people even have partners and still do it. It 's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure. In anticipating this inevitability, are n't they then giving away they 're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from? They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous. Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it. Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get. Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000. I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I 'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way. I do n't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship. This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to. Like I 've said, is n't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others? It does n't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers. I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they 're purposely looking for attention they ca n't find within their immediate relationships. You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Just because you do n't find it empowering to post nudes, does n't mean other people wo n't. It 's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention. Similarly, I have sent photos of this nature to various girls who I was not dating. However, I have never posted nudes online. I 'm somewhere in between this spectrum. I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex ( impossible since I did n't live near them). I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well. Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it 's own set of motivations. I guess a big issue that others here have pointed out is my distinction between empowering and attention seeking. I just do n't understand that you 're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just ca n't grasp it. The trouble I have is that I do n't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online. You 're right about the sexting thing, and that 's where, as I stated in another comment, the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous. Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often, so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes. Just as I do n't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists do n't understand how I *don't* find joy from it. Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I ca n't make an uninformed judgement about it. I am not going to tell that person that he / she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it ( the person may not even know either)!", "output": "<Explicit> Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering. </Explicit> <Explicit> Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like. </Explicit> <Explicit> I do n't care if people post nudes, I 'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes. </Explicit> <Explicit> Also, I do n't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes. </Explicit> <Explicit> Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity </Explicit> <Explicit> I just do n't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim. </Explicit> <Implicit> Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention. </Implicit> <Explicit> Of course, that 's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that 's their personality and that they feed off of attention. </Explicit> <Explicit> Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend ( hence the throwaway), have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with\" it makes me feel good.\" </Explicit> <Explicit> Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either do n't have an answer or somehow say it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body. </Explicit> <Implicit> I do n't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you ( /r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. </Implicit> <Explicit> So reddit, why do people post nudes?

{"input": "Eugenics is n't all that bad ... And we do n't even have to kill anyone for it. Okay, I 'm talking about making the human race smarter, forever. Intelligence is at least partially genetic and therefore passed down by parents, yes? So, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people ( I 'm against killing. Of most things.) we just limit offspring? For example, we could use the IQ scale ( for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to. Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that 's the number of offspring you 're allowed to create. So someone with near average intelligence ( near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children ( not each.) and sustain their population. Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children ... and so on. This would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. I know this would be a bitch to implement and it 's near impossible to actually do, but I 'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused ... I know all that. Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she ca n't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we 're not gon na kill one Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer ( almost 100 percent or something) takes off more ... Something like that. Much better than\" Kill off those with IQ less than 80\" I would n't mind a smarter human race ... **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.** **It looks to me like you 've made so many exceptions to your main view that you are n't looking to have your view changed. I 'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it 's incorrect.** Firstly, IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect. Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible. It may also be important to note that your system is n't only difficult to implement like you point out, it 's also in direct conflict with how things actually work. More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated. There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc. Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test. This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80 ..... that would change nothing. The average IQ will still be measured in the same way, the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same. Firstly, I mentioned that. (\" for want of better measure of intelligence\") I would love a better measure of intelligence. Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too ... So, maybe a complex way to combine them. Like a total of all of them. Idc. I know about number two ... I 'm not proposing we implement it. In a perfect world, sure. But at least my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people. Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less\" less intelligent people\" ( and that would always be the case ...) I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test. Again, I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is ( seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence. ( better than SAT scores, right?) And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for\" da murder\" if we were to take that route in the first place. instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever The\" number of mental retardation\" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too so I do n't see your point there. In total, everyone 's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter ... My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it. Separating intelligence into categories * is * a far better way to go about it, but by it 's very nature implies you can not sum them. A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories. The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still do n't fully understand. It is also downright silly to consider since, as we know it is n't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner. I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is ( seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement. 1. Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones. If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences ... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being ( weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy. I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still do n't fully understand. Eh, maybe we do n't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right? Just because we do n't understand every minute aspect of it does n't mean we ca n't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it. Well hopefully it would n't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you 'd be hurting future generation 's intelligence. This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement. Let me clarify! You misinterpreted, I would n't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all, I used it as an example of an intelligence measure, and I meant most available as the\" most available / recognizable example of intelligence\" I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this. Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones. If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences ... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being ( weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy. I think you are still oversimplifying it. And no you ca n't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population. Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you can not feasibly do this. What if someone with a low intellect ( however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed? Also, only one of my parents finished high school. I am their 6th child. I have a Masters degree. ( See my user history for reference). We do n't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing. I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest. The\" Yeah but what if ...\" thing just is n't going to fly. It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort. Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count. Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they do n't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount? I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population. I do n't think its feasible, though ... Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ ( which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are) We do n't know all, true, but we know some, which should be enough to increase intelligence. Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest ... I 'm sorry, maybe I should n't have posted this topic. I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good. 1. Eugenics is not realistically feasible 2. But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing Eugenics would work if eugenics worked. That 's basically all you 've said. Which is basically like saying if unicorns were real, they would be real. Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ ( which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are) No. I think you 'll find someone who has a degree in topic X is a much better indicator of their holistic intellectual ability with respect to category X than a simple reductive IQ test.

{"input": "Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system. As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function. Example: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss. The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy. The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day. At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500. Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each. She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls, but the only people available to sell to are the workers, who 's total funds are £500. No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit. This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that can not be sold must still be produced and thrown away. The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces. Most people are n't paid on commission, so this is n't really a good example, but I think I get where you 're going with it. if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce But the money does n't just disappear. For one thing, you 're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning ( and presumably gets paid) but does n't\" produce\" anything. You 're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things. Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced. This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that 's where supply and demand are involved. I 'm not going to deny that sometimes ( or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and does n't re-inject it, but that 's more a failure of the system than the system itself. The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it wo n't sell and will be waste, but that 's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.

{"input": "America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. Modern technology like the internet must be considered. Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as\" useful\" is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock. The attitude of human value as\" what they [ potentially] contributed to me / Exxon Mobile\" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit. It 's the same problem with war: Once killing foreigners is an acceptable / inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it. Other countries also build militaries to do so and to\" defend\" against each other, and its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do because everybody 's doing it and so must do it. It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries. This works on the inverse too. When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed. Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed. You 'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today the\" religions of the book\" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves. Also, it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers; now it 's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves. The Zeitgeist changes, as people 's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving. This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school. In it, intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization, data treated as\" fact\" or\" fiction\" ( in reality, everything is true / untrue depending on it 's level of resolution or accuracy), children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around. On this, they 're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not. The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the\" efficient\" cattle model. Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems. We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of\" product\" to be\" thrown away\" and that seen as okay but the worst thing is not that, but the Zeitgeist within society that people should be\" grown\", and graded, and that these categories are accurate. Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did, that it 's\" true\" or not and that\" truth\" is available to us in an absolute way, and that smart people are cooperative. Political parties appeal to these learned biases. The general attitude among the adult population is\" do n't think too much\", because it 's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing. So with 55 million abortions, you 're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a\" better place\" is that come with it. Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems. You see, there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too. Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal, and I 'm not saying such a strike would have been worth it, only that benefits would exist and it 's our job to weigh those against the costs always. If you can not see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking, which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively. You 're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome. Think America in 1000 years. This America faced a sustainable growth rate. Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces. Pretend that technology has reached such a point that any human can pursue any passion they wish. These Americans can go enjoy the wilderness of a terraformed planet ( or use their immortality to wait until that is possible), enter a virtual reality program and experience any event by any person in history as if it was true, go see dinosaurs at the zoo, pursue as many doctorates as they 'd like, increase or decrease their intelligence, and never have to work a day of their lives to earn such privileges. Now imagine America in 200 years. Babies were created indiscriminately. The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970. Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue. Everything is polluted to hell. The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse. The perception of the value of human life goes to zero. I am in no way claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal / illegal abortion. My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future. My illustrations are ridiculous Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said. Your claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life. That is true, and such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome. This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations. I believe you are in agreement with that. However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration. This is where we disagree. I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat. I also do n't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the\" do n't think too much\" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you 're making. If the quality of life is higher, you 'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they 'd like. If the quality of life is lower, you 'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner, the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much. Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist. I believe you are in agreement with that. However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration. This is where we disagree. I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat. No, I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [ how many other X-factors might exist,] and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects. I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism ( no offense). I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning. See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally: It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder. I 'm telling you this because you 're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are, and having them challenge you and show disgust. Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they 're antisocial, even when they 're around people, and so they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster. That said, giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view, but the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched. You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective. See, the reason people are highly sensitive [ emotionally] is the same reason you 'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor: Because you 're concerned you 'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something. The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment. This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included. Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it 's [ almost never because they 're on a higher tier of information or understanding], but because they do n't even know that they do n't know. In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they 've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance. It 's why we recruit teens into the military. They 're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences. Anyway, that 's why I gave that explanation, and you did n't anticipate it, but thought you did, did n't you? You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best, but it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style. You probably do n't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style. This is the problem with X-factors and complexity. You do n't know what you do n't know, you did n't know you did n't know my motivation, and you do n't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences. So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation. Essentially, i 'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you 're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans? My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is? teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial. These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior. As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments. You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place. It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself. Also, I do n't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views. On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent. I have not said a single thing in this thread that i 've been absolutely sure of. Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris. It boils down to a well constructed shitpost. *those abortions may have been a good thing? you can have that thought?? you are a retard! argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country? I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things! Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am, yet how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being*, and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself. Essentially, i 'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you 're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans? Therapy. I like that. So personal; very theatrical. Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it 's inferior without it being a big deal? This is Change My View. Did you expect people to *not* shoot holes in your reasoning? My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is? I 'm pretty sure that 's how everybody 's mind works at all times, and that I said that, and you know that:) I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low. I 'd of liked this to have been mature, and you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV. To change your view, they inevitably have to think you 're wrong on some level of analysis. Did n't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least? Or did I do it too offensively well? Teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial. These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior. Teens are still developing, you know. There 's [ plenty of research] supporting that their minds are n't fully developed and that they 're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness. Also I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder, and that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it 's not, in explaining how people think emotionally and why in a way you could understand. And you can understand it, and do; which is why you 're pissed. I did n't tell you to change your view because you 're inferior, and I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences ( which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why. Do n't try and punish me for talking to you. As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments. Name one. You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah. I think you 're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post 's shadow, and how you hate it. I like the implied sexual dominance part. I 'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that. I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it. It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself. Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things, but let 's not spit hairs. Yeah it 's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong. There 's not a lot of sense in thinking things you do n't think are true. Also, I do n't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views. On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent. I have not said a single thing in this thread that i 've been absolutely sure of. Most folks do n't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them. At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it. If you came up and said you hated black people I 'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too. Not exactly humble beliefs, are they. See, no emotional awareness. Harvard study. My posts. Read them. You do n't understand the signals you 're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them -- likely true information. You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had, and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect. It 's good that you 've distanced yourself from your view in saying you 're not that confident in it. It 's one step closer to abandoning it. Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris. It boils down to a well constructed shitpost.: D those abortions may have been a good thing? you can have that thought?? you are a retard! argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country? I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things! Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond. I did anticipate this, and I 'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view -- more specifically, that sort of thinking. It 'll go well with you to be smarter than that. I think it 's working. I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking. Enjoy it. People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you 're wrong. Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions. Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am, yet how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being, * and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself. It 's Dunning-Kruger. Also your view did n't anticipate the human element an iota, and that was a lapse in emotion that revealed your age. Once you learn what you do n't know, you will have made a dent in knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing. In other words, it would n't be a drop in the ocean, so if you 're squeamish about being ignorant you should n't have been born, because everybody is ignorant of most things. Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience. As for you, fix those thought patterns and get used to it, because you 're going to readjust a lot. Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be\" right\", because sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good. Therapy. I like that. So personal; very theatrical. Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it 's inferior without it being a big deal? This is Change My View. Did you expect people to not shoot holes in your reasoning? If my reasoning is inferior, than prove the original view along with the logic behind it wrong. Its that simple. I would n't say you shot holes in my idea, more so that you used an unnecessary amount of time and effort to make a few simple points. I 'm pretty sure that 's how everybody 's mind works at all times, and that I said that, and you know that:) Most minds do n't work in such a way that they have to ignore information to function. The claim that one has to be emotionally retarded to have such a thought is ridiculous.\":)\" you seem to have been made mad by my comment and then put anger into the rest of your response. I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low. Perhaps it is shallow, but it is the topic you set, no? I 'd of liked this to have been mature, and you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV. To change your view, they inevitably have to think you 're wrong on some level of analysis. Of course, but that does n't mean that I have to agree with you when I see you as wrong. Did n't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least? Or did I do it too offensively well? I absolutely expected to be chewed alive for every fallacy I had. What I was *annoyed* by were your unfounded and arrogant assumptions. Teens are still developing, you know. There 's plenty of research supporting that their minds are n't fully developed and that they 're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness. Also I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder, and that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it 's not, in explaining how people think emotionally and why in a way you could understand. There you go again. You claim i 'm too underdeveloped to argue with, I should just accept your view, flush my brain of such thoughts, and continue about my day. You truly are ridiculous. And you can understand it, and do; which is why you 're pissed. I did n't tell you to change your view because you 're inferior, and I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences ( which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why. Do n't try and punish me for talking to you. I 'm not anticipating consequences? That was the entire point of my CMV. Did you not even read any of this? Did you not see the note that said that I was fishing for insight into the impact of 55 million abortions? You could have actually posed consequences to change my view. And Christ, you said you *had the courtesy to explain this to me*. Kid ... As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments. Name one. Anyway, that 's why I gave that explanation, and you did n't anticipate it, but thought you did, did n't you? ( 1) You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best ( 2), but it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style. You probably do n't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style ( 3). This is the problem with X-factors and complexity ( 4). You do n't know what you do n't know, you did n't know you did n't know my motivation, and you do n't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing ( The point of the thread, no?), or what interests were operating in the establishment of them ( The point of the thread, no?), or the consequences ( The point of the thread, no?). So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation ( heck of a statement without an argument behind it) If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah. I think you 're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post 's shadow, and how you hate it. A little self important eh? I like the implied sexual dominance part. I 'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that. I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it. You seem to be quasi-psychotic Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things, but let 's not spit hairs. Yeah it 's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong. There 's not a lot of sense in thinking things you do n't think are true. Rambling on. Most folks do n't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them. At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it. If you came up and said you hated black people I 'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too. Not exactly humble beliefs, are they. First of all, your comments, under your own description of the Dunning Krueger effect, have some serious ass Dunning Krueger. Second of all, I had reasoning behind my views, and was confident about the reasoning, but came here in expectance that there was some reasoning that I had not yet considered which may change my opinion. I came here to learn. I came here expecting myself to be proven wrong. You certainly were n't close to proving anything. See, no emotional awareness. Harvard study. My posts. Read them. You do n't understand the signals you 're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them -- likely true information. Having a thought, however morbid and efficient, is not enough to indicate a lack of emotional intelligence. People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views. Then you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior. Really, were you home-schooled? Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that was n't weened until the age of 15. You also have special snowflake syndrome. All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i 'll trust how very *smart* you sound. I 'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct? This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion. Also, your\" Harvard studies, read them\" was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion. You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had Read: post title. and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect. 600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought. It 's good that you 've distanced yourself from your view in saying you 're not that confident in it. It 's one step closer to abandoning it. I 'm not going to *abandon* a view, i 'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind. Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond. Oh? Then why is this post so popular? Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you 're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea. I did anticipate this, and I 'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view -- more specifically, that sort of thinking. It 'll go well with you to be smarter than that. Visit the subreddit /r/iamverysmart to see your error I think it 's working. I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking. Enjoy it. People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you 're wrong. You 're one of those people you imply? See: Dunning Krueger. Also, see the numerous other similar things you 've said that do n't actually contribute to the discussion, all you 're doing is attempting to devalue the argument and myself. Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions. Praise jesus! this intellectual has blessed me with correcting my false facts! I should be thankful! knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing. Its like you say the same thing over and over again and make it as convoluted as possible Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience. Is n't this another one of those places where you were supposed to contribute to the discussion rather than doing your * i 'm an intellectual* masturbation? As for you, fix those thought patterns and get used to it, because you 're going to readjust a lot. Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be\" right\", because sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good Ahh. I 'm susceptible to politics and religion because I disagree with you. Bonus fedora points!!", "output": "<Implicit> America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. </Implicit> <Explicit> There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. </Explicit> <Explicit> Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. </Explicit> <Implicit> These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. </Implicit> <Implicit> Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. </Implicit> <Implicit> One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. </Implicit> <Implicit> Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. </Implicit> <Implicit> America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. </Implicit> <Implicit> Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. </Implicit> <Implicit> I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point </Implicit> <Explicit> what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. </Explicit> <Implicit> Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? </Implicit> <Explicit> Its a complicated issue. </Explicit> <Implicit> Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? </Implicit> <Implicit> Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? </Implicit> <Implicit> Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? </Implicit> <Implicit> Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. </Implicit> <Implicit> Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? </Implicit> <Implicit> This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. </Implicit> <Explicit> Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. </Explicit> <Explicit> no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point </Explicit> <Explicit> Then there is the next question. </Explicit> <Explicit> Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? </Explicit> <Implicit> Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. </Implicit> <Explicit> Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. </Explicit> <Explicit> This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. </Explicit> <Explicit> Modern technology like the internet must be considered. </Explicit> <Explicit> Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. </Explicit> <Explicit> I am now confused and lost. </Explicit> <Explicit> I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. </Explicit> <Explicit> I also see a few times where I got redundant. </Explicit> <Explicit> One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as\" useful\" is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone </Explicit> <Implicit> A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock. </Implicit> <Implicit> The attitude of human value as\" what they [ potentially] contributed to me / Exxon Mobile\" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's the same problem with war: Once killing foreigners is an acceptable / inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it. </Explicit> <Explicit> Other countries also build militaries to do so and to\" defend\" against each other, and its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do because everybody 's doing it and so must do it. </Explicit> <Explicit> It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries. </Explicit> <Explicit> This works on the inverse too. </Explicit> <Explicit> When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed. </Explicit> <Explicit> Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed. </Explicit> <Explicit> You 'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today </Explicit> <Implicit> the\" religions of the book\" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves. </Implicit> <Explicit> Also, it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers; now it 's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves. </Explicit> <Explicit> The Zeitgeist changes, as people 's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving. </Explicit> <Implicit> This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school. </Implicit> <Implicit> In it, intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization, data treated as\" fact\" or\" fiction\" ( in reality, everything is true / untrue depending on it 's level of resolution or accuracy), children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around. </Implicit> <Explicit> On this, they 're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not. </Explicit> <Implicit> The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the\" efficient\" cattle model. </Implicit> <Implicit> Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems. </Implicit> <Implicit> We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of\" product\" to be\" thrown away\" and that seen as okay </Implicit> <Implicit> but the worst thing is not that, but the Zeitgeist within society that people should be\" grown\", and graded, and that these categories are accurate. </Implicit> <Implicit> Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did, that it 's\" true\" or not and that\" truth\" is available to us in an absolute way, and that smart people are cooperative. </Implicit> <Explicit> Political parties appeal to these learned biases. </Explicit> <Explicit> The general attitude among the adult population is\" do n't think too much\", because it 's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing. </Explicit> <Implicit> So with 55 million abortions, you 're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a\" better place\" is that come with it. </Implicit> <Implicit> Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems. </Implicit> <Implicit> You see, there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too. </Implicit> <Implicit> Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal, and I 'm not saying such a strike would have been worth it, only that benefits would exist and it 's our job to weigh those against the costs always. </Implicit> <Implicit> If you can not see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking, which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively. </Implicit> <Explicit> You 're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome. </Explicit> <Explicit> Think America in 1000 years. </Explicit> <Explicit> This America faced a sustainable growth rate. </Explicit> <Explicit> Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces. </Explicit> <Explicit> Pretend that technology has reached such a point that any human can pursue any passion they wish. </Explicit> <Explicit> These Americans can go enjoy the wilderness of a terraformed planet ( or use their immortality to wait until that is possible), enter a virtual reality program and experience any event by any person in history as if it was true, go see dinosaurs at the zoo, pursue as many doctorates as they 'd like, increase or decrease their intelligence, and never have to work a day of their lives to earn such privileges. </Explicit> <Explicit> Now imagine America in 200 years. </Explicit> <Explicit> Babies were created indiscriminately. </Explicit> <Explicit> The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970. </Explicit> <Explicit> Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue. </Explicit> <Explicit> Everything is polluted to hell. </Explicit> <Explicit> The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse. </Explicit> <Explicit> The perception of the value of human life goes to zero. </Explicit> <Explicit> I am in no way claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal / illegal abortion. </Explicit> <Explicit> My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future. </Explicit> <Explicit> My illustrations are ridiculous </Explicit> <Explicit> Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said. </Explicit> <Explicit> Your claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life. </Explicit> <Explicit> That is true, and such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome. </Explicit> <Implicit> This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations. </Implicit> <Explicit> I believe you are in agreement with that. </Explicit> <Implicit> However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration. </Implicit> <Explicit> This is where we disagree. </Explicit> <Implicit> I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat. </Implicit> <Implicit> I also do n't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the\" do n't think too much\" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you 're making. </Implicit> <Explicit> If the quality of life is higher, you 'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they 'd like. </Explicit> <Explicit> If the quality of life is lower, you 'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner, the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much. </Explicit> <Explicit> Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist. </Explicit> <Explicit> I believe you are in agreement with that. </Explicit> <Implicit> However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration. </Implicit> <Explicit> This is where we disagree. </Explicit> <Implicit> I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat. </Implicit> <Implicit> No, I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [ how many other X-factors might exist,] and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects. </Implicit> <Implicit> I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism ( no offense). </Implicit> <Explicit> I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning. </Explicit> <Explicit> See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally: It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder. </Explicit> <Explicit> I 'm telling you this because you 're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are, and having them challenge you and show disgust. </Explicit> <Explicit> Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they 're antisocial, even when they 're around people, and so they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster. </Explicit> <Implicit> That said, giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view, but the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched. </Implicit> <Implicit> You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective. </Implicit> <Implicit> See, the reason people are highly sensitive [ emotionally] is the same reason you 'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor: Because you 're concerned you 'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something. </Implicit> <Explicit> The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment. </Explicit> <Implicit> This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included. </Implicit> <Implicit> Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it 's [ almost never because they 're on a higher tier of information or understanding], but because they do n't even know that they do n't know. </Implicit> <Implicit> In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they 've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's why we recruit teens into the military. </Explicit> <Explicit> They 're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences. </Explicit> <Implicit> Anyway, that 's why I gave that explanation, and you did n't anticipate it, but thought you did, did n't you? </Implicit> <Explicit> You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best, but it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style. </Explicit> <Explicit> You probably do n't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style. </Explicit> <Explicit> This is the problem with X-factors and complexity. </Explicit> <Implicit> You do n't know what you do n't know, you did n't know you did n't know my motivation, and you do n't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences. </Implicit> <Implicit> So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation. </Implicit> <Explicit> Essentially, i 'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you 're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans? </Explicit> <Implicit> My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is? </Implicit> <Explicit> teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial. </Explicit> <Explicit> These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior. </Explicit> <Explicit> As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. </Explicit> <Implicit> There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments. </Implicit> <Explicit> You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place. </Explicit> <Implicit> It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself. </Implicit> <Explicit> Also, I do n't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views. </Explicit> <Implicit> On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent. </Implicit> <Explicit> I have not said a single thing in this thread that i 've been absolutely sure of. </Explicit> <Explicit> Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris. It boils down to a well constructed shitpost. </Explicit> <Explicit> *those abortions may have been a good thing? you can have that thought?? you are a retard! </Explicit> <Explicit> argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country? I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things! </Explicit> <Implicit> Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am, yet how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being*, and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself. </Implicit> <Explicit> Essentially, i 'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you 're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans? </Explicit> <Implicit> Therapy </Implicit> <Implicit> . I like that. So personal; very theatrical. </Implicit> <Explicit> Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it 's inferior without it being a big deal? </Explicit> <Explicit> This is Change My View. Did you expect people to *not* shoot holes in your reasoning? </Explicit> <Implicit> My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is? </Implicit> <Implicit> I 'm pretty sure that 's how everybody 's mind works at all times, and that I said that, and you know that:) </Implicit> <Implicit> I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low. </Implicit> <Explicit> I 'd of liked this to have been mature, and you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV. </Explicit> <Explicit> To change your view, they inevitably have to think you 're wrong on some level of analysis. </Explicit> <Explicit> Did n't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least? </Explicit> <Explicit> Or did I do it too offensively well? </Explicit> <Explicit> Teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial. </Explicit> <Explicit> These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior. </Explicit> <Explicit> Teens are still developing, you know. </Explicit> <Explicit> There 's [ plenty of research] supporting that their minds are n't fully developed and that they 're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness. </Explicit> <Explicit> Also I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder, and that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it 's not, in explaining how people think emotionally and why in a way you could understand. </Explicit> <Explicit> And you can understand it, and do; which is why you 're pissed. </Explicit> <Explicit> I did n't tell you to change your view because you 're inferior, and I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences ( which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why. </Explicit> <Explicit> Do n't try and punish me for talking to you. </Explicit> <Explicit> As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. </Explicit> <Implicit> There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments. </Implicit> <Explicit> Name one. </Explicit> <Explicit> You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place </Explicit> <Explicit> If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah. </Explicit> <Explicit> I think you 're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post 's shadow, and how you hate it. </Explicit> <Implicit> I like the implied sexual dominance part. </Implicit> <Implicit> I 'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that. </Implicit> <Explicit> I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it. </Explicit> <Implicit> It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself. </Implicit> <Implicit> Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things, but let 's not spit hairs. </Implicit> <Implicit> Yeah it 's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong. </Implicit> <Implicit> There 's not a lot of sense in thinking things you do n't think are true. </Implicit> <Explicit> Also, I do n't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views. </Explicit> <Implicit> On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent. </Implicit> <Explicit> I have not said a single thing in this thread that i 've been absolutely sure of. </Explicit> <Implicit> Most folks do n't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them. </Implicit> <Implicit> At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it. </Implicit> <Implicit> If you came up and said you hated black people I 'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too. </Implicit> <Implicit> Not exactly humble beliefs, are they. </Implicit> <Implicit> See, no emotional awareness. </Implicit> <Implicit> Harvard study.

{"input": "Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare. 1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan / vegetarian diet are slim to none 1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products 2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand 3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. 4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. 4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However: 5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare. My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover, this practice would be much easier to\" evangelize\" than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it, meat is tasty and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience A lot ( dunno %) vegetarians / vegans see killing animals for food is fundamentally unethical.

{"input": "Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear. I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It 's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace. I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place. Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. Unfortunately with the world 's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Would n't restricting\" free speech\" put brakes on this sort of recruitment? Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism. Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies. Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just is n't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society. As other 's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are. Here 's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details. Zero tolerance, whatever it takes. Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism and their poison should be kept out of the minds of children. Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination. In a highly connected online era, it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement. When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem. The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough. Now, this is obviously extreme, but you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness. The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe is n't really all that subjective. Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous. Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous. I do n't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is? Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable. Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office. Well we have the benefit of history. The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center. In a stable democracy this is n't too hard to figure out. Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia were n't all that stable. Well we have the benefit of history. So did they. Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves. Ever heard of the Reign of Terror? The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center. And who gets to decide what being a moderate was, and why is it tied to what the majority wants? Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives, and throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit. In a stable democracy this is n't too hard to figure out. Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening? It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas. Also, stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things. 100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee. But has n't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it. I do agree that today 's moderates are potentially tomorrow 's conservatives. However this is n't about being just a bit conservative. It 's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder. Conservatives do n't do this, it 's extremists. Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening? There will always be evil people that bring misery to the world. Why is it wrong to try and stop them? But has n't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it. People thought the exact same thing before WWI. They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years. And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what 's happening in the middle east. Hell, Rwanda was n't that long ago either. And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented. I do agree that today 's moderates are potentially tomorrow 's conservatives. However this is n't about being just a bit conservative. It 's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder. One person 's terrorist is another person 's freedom fighter. One 's person 's genocide is another person 's defense of their culture. One person 's murderer is a other 's soldier. Now, I do n't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly are n't hard to make. And they certainly have been made throughout history. Conservatives do n't do this, it 's extremists. Exactly, my point there was n't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes. It is n't some objective fact about people. J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he 's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought. The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable is n't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction ( either failing to get bad people or getting good people) Your first paragraph is intriguing, and I definitely agree with it. The freedom fighter / terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective.

{"input": "The highest form of relationship between men and women doomed to be romance. Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex, but I 'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.\" Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?\" I wonder my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss 's *The Game* Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more? Why ca n't I be friends with girls ( even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I do n't try to advance some romantic agenda? Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them? I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding I want to know what older, more mature people think. It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy 's school for the majority of my life. At times, I feel like the interplay between men and women is always ( at least always initially) a bs game where the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner. Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me that I ca n't stand it. Well, first off, there 's the fact that most people are n't interested in romance with family members of the opposite sex, but I figure you 're excluding that. So, here 's what I 've experienced as a 19-year-old male college student. A lot of the times, yes, women and men do interact in a romantic way, one trying to impress the other to get involved in romance. It happens. There are a lot of great, good-looking people out there. Jeez, my college is known for being the land of partying, gorgeous college people. But romance just is n't as cut and dry as that. The one thing I 've learned about life and romance going through high school and college? There is no manual. None. And we try to define all of these interactions between the sexes as one thing or another because it 's easy. But it really isn't. I can think a girl is absolutely gorgeous and still be friends with them, mostly because I do n't think she 's the one for me. That does n't devalue them just because I do n't feel like I want to keep someone exclusively to myself does n't mean I care for them any less. And just trying to be romantic with women, assuming the endgoal of any compatible people is romance, completely cuts out some of the most beautiful times you can have with people. I 've taught a friend how to drive, letting her find a passion in a shitty life. I 've spent countless all-nighters with a friend just shooting shit, due to insomnia and boredom. I 've held a friend so close after she told me I was the biggest reason she had n't killed herself. I 've watched stars fall on a hilltop so clear and beautiful as I called a friend a sister for the first time. So many interactions. So many beautiful, hard, wonderful, life-changing experiences I 've had because of friendships with women. And it 's no harder than being a friend with a guy, because we seem to forget so many times that women are people too, they are sad, happy, lonely and joyful at times, just like us. So stop thinking about how it 's supposed to be done and just let things go on. If you want to be exclusive with a girl, go for it. But sometimes? Sometimes you love a person without needing to hold them close to you. Something as simple and beautiful as all that should never, ever be left unexperienced. This is a great way to look at it. I come from this all-boy 's school background, and I ca n't shake the feeling of loss when a male friend of mine gets together with a female friend. I feel like I 'm impinging on their relationship whenever I try to interact with the girl because I 'm afraid that my male friend will think that there 's some ulterior motive involved. What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship does n't have to be romantic, yet for some reason I wonder how you 've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.

I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups. For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists. my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.

{"input": "There is only one\" right\" way to play the Mass Effect series *for title clarification, I am NOT referring to either of the paragon or renegade affiliations as the main topic for this post* The Mass Effect games, however flawed though they may be, are some of my favorite games of all time. Now that my bias is clear, I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason I 'd like my view changed. I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass. Needless to say, this post is really only meant for those who 've played the series, but if you 're not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in. If you let any one of your squadmates die, ( unless their deaths are unavoidable) you are: a.) incompetent Talk to squadmates semi-regularly, do the loyalty missions, buy the ship upgrades, and -for Gaben 's sake- put some points into persuade ( you Neanderthal!), and do n't make stupid ( YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission. It 's really not that difficult with a little common sense! RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission? RELOAD A DAMN SAVE. It 's worth it dammit! b.) rushing / missing the damn point of the game Do n't give me that\" I do n't have time\" crap; you bought an RPG! You 're already taking a good bit time to play the game, so why not take a little more and immerse yourself in the sexy sci-fi universe you paid good money for? You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore. c.) unfit to fairly criticize the series Firstly, I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was ( see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details). However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard 's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. For example, ( SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material. Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 did n't live up to the hype. How could it? It 's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion, it 's a complete waste of the player 's time going about it that way. Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies. I need help guys. It 's getting to the point where I ca n't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. Hell, I 've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough. I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them but for whatever reason it 's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular. Just wanted to say that I do n't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It 's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could 've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole. Or maybe you just like plots and characters and different stories. I 'd say my approach was different - if the material is in the game, it 's there for a purpose. It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories. I did do the completionist run! I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not. However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches. I was *pissed as hell* at the [ ME3 ending] ( and I do n't think, as another fan, you 'll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. Where an ending that 's a fuck you to everything Shepard 's been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepard 's done. Where it is n't a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead. And so I made the world 's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard. And if you ask me? It 's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard, but taken with ME3 's ending, I think it makes for a far better story. A renegade lady who was n't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests ( and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops). Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. Trust me, when you play a character who 's a lot more of an asshole but who 's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it 's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary ( when you, the player, know that they are n't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience. It 's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'. They 're not hollow at all, they 're fantastic. The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could 've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*. They lose everyone who trusted them in some way or another, and *hurt* through it all. The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead. Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it did n't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that 's your ending for you. Shitty failure Shepard 's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she 'd burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left. To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I 'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it. Every other *possible* ending that could 've been, she 'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions. Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences. Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough I 'd say that the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that 's screwed up the whole way. I do n't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it 's whatever Shepard I 'm playing in that particular runthrough that 's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard. The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'. The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied. For me, that was n't a completionist run. I can play as 'saves everyone' Shepard and also as 'total stupid asshole' Shepard - neither of them are me-the-player, they 're just the main characters in their own stories. The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that 's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself. Also, OP, if you 're complaining that people who let companions die miss out on content later in the game, you should consider that as a person who played through ME several times ( these were n't actually my only Shepards, I have also tried every romance because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), I 've actually experienced far more of it than you have. The 'but you see less of it if you do this other route' ignores that you can just play the game again. I suppose I had n't really though to consider the complexities of a\" shitty-Shep\" in relation to the flaws of the game itself. The absence of certain characters is valid too, even though losing squadmembers would be more somber than I 'd personally prefer. Almost poetic in a way, but I think I 'll stick to going the long way around if I 'm going to invest any time in another I suppose I should have mentioned that this would be in the case of a person doing a\" final\" canon run for THEIR Shep, and making those decisions on who to save and what to do.", "output": "<Implicit> There is only one\" right\" way to play the Mass Effect series </Implicit> <Implicit> *for title clarification, I am NOT referring to either of the paragon or renegade affiliations as the main topic for this post* </Implicit> <Implicit> The Mass Effect games, however flawed though they may be, are some of my favorite games of all time. </Implicit> <Explicit> Now that my bias is clear, I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason I 'd like my view changed. </Explicit> <Explicit> I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass. </Explicit> <Explicit> Needless to say, this post is really only meant for those who 've played the series, but if you 're not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in. </Explicit> <Explicit> If you let any one of your squadmates die, ( unless their deaths are unavoidable) you are: </Explicit> <Explicit> a.) incompetent </Explicit> <Explicit> Talk to squadmates semi-regularly, do the loyalty missions, buy the ship upgrades, and -for Gaben 's sake- put some points into persuade ( you Neanderthal!), and do n't make stupid ( YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission. </Explicit> <Explicit> It 's really not that difficult with a little common sense! </Explicit> <Implicit> RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission?

It 's getting to the point where I ca n't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. </Explicit> <Explicit> Hell, I 've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough. </Explicit> <Explicit> I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them </Explicit> <Explicit> but for whatever reason it 's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular. </Explicit> <Implicit> Just wanted to say that I do n't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could 've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole. </Explicit> <Explicit> Or maybe you just like plots and characters and different stories. </Explicit> <Implicit> I 'd say my approach was different - if the material is in the game, it 's there for a purpose. </Implicit> <Implicit> It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. </Implicit> <Implicit> And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories. </Implicit> <Implicit> I did do the completionist run! </Implicit> <Implicit> I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not. </Implicit> <Explicit> However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches. </Explicit> <Explicit> I was *pissed as hell* at the [ ME3 ending] ( and I do n't think, as another fan, you 'll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) </Explicit> <Implicit> so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. </Implicit> <Implicit> Where an ending that 's a fuck you to everything Shepard 's been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepard 's done. </Implicit> <Implicit> Where it is n't a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead. </Implicit> <Implicit> And so I made the world 's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard. </Implicit> <Implicit> And if you ask me? It 's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard, but taken with ME3 's ending, I think it makes for a far better story. </Implicit> <Implicit> A renegade lady who was n't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests ( and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops). </Implicit> <Implicit> Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. </Implicit> <Implicit> Trust me, when you play a character who 's a lot more of an asshole but who 's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it 's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary ( when you, the player, know that they are n't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience. </Implicit> <Explicit> It 's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'. </Explicit> <Explicit> They 're not hollow at all, they 're fantastic. </Explicit> <Explicit> The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could 've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*. </Explicit> <Explicit> They lose everyone who trusted them in some way or another, and *hurt* through it all. </Explicit> <Explicit> The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead. </Explicit> <Implicit> Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it did n't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that 's your ending for you. </Implicit> <Implicit> Shitty failure Shepard 's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she 'd burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left. </Implicit> <Explicit> To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I 'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it. </Explicit> <Implicit> Every other *possible* ending that could 've been, she 'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions. </Implicit> <Implicit> Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences. </Implicit> <Explicit> Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough </Explicit> <Explicit> I 'd say that the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that 's screwed up the whole way. </Explicit> <Explicit> I do n't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it 's whatever Shepard I 'm playing in that particular runthrough that 's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard. </Explicit> <Explicit> The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'. </Explicit> <Explicit> The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied. </Explicit> <Explicit> For me, that was n't a completionist run. </Explicit> <Explicit> I can play as 'saves everyone' Shepard and also as 'total stupid asshole' Shepard - neither of them are me-the-player, they 're just the main characters in their own stories. </Explicit> <Explicit> The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that 's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself. </Explicit> <Explicit> Also, OP, if you 're complaining that people who let companions die miss out on content later in the game, you should consider that as a person who played through ME several times ( these were n't actually my only Shepards, I have also tried every romance because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), I 've actually experienced far more of it than you have. </Explicit> <Explicit> The 'but you see less of it if you do this other route' ignores that you can just play the game again. </Explicit> <Implicit> I suppose I had n't really though to consider the complexities of a\" shitty-Shep\" in relation to the flaws of the game itself. </Implicit> <Implicit> The absence of certain characters is valid too, even though losing squadmembers would be more somber than I 'd personally prefer. </Implicit> <Implicit> Almost poetic in a way, but I think I 'll stick to going the long way around if I 'm going to invest any time in another </Implicit> <Implicit> I suppose I should have mentioned that this would be in the case of a person doing a\" final\" canon run for THEIR Shep, and making those decisions on who to save and what to do. </Implicit>"}
