{"input": "Patriotism is the belief that being born on one side of a line makes you better. American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people should not be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”. I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief. I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one 's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others. Therefore I would say that the antithesis of patriotism is not having a global perspective, but is in fact selfishness. Someone who attempts to extract gain for themselves at harm to their overall country is acting unpatriotically, someone who assists another country that is in worse shape instead of assisting their own can still be a patriot, but also recognize significant need in other nations and decide to assist them as well. Whether you support immigration or not, so long as you are supporting what you believe is best for your nation, you are still acting patriotically, and even if you decide to support another nation you can still be acting patriotically as well so long as you support your nation too. This is true, but, I think, supporting the common good is also more important than supporting your country.

Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex, but I 'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.\" Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?\" I wonder my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss 's *The Game* Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more Why ca n't I be friends with girls ( even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I do n't try to advance some romantic agenda? Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them? I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding I want to know what older, more mature people think. It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy 's school for the majority of my life. At times, I feel like the interplay between men and women is always ( at least always initially) a bs game where the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner. Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me that I ca n't stand it. Id just like to point out that this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian. Beyond that, there are many people who want close relationships without romance, an obvious example would be asexual people. They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage, but how would you even quantify that? How can you even compare them? What about the relationship of a brother and sister? If you limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women, then maybe you 're right, but then again who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple? The bottom line is that people are different from you can relationships are hard to compare. Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance. For someone other hetero guy it might not be. Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off so even if you 're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship you 'll still probably feel attraction for other people. Thats just reality for most people, and its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow. There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships. In short, I do n't need to feel guilty when I 'm attracted to people I know I ca n't have? Maybe I 'm too black-and-white to think that the murmurs of my id are natural and not evil. As for which relationship is *higher* from a quantifiable standpoint, I see what you mean. When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort, but of a level of worth. Looking at that statement, however, I think you 're right again -- who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship? It 's a bit extreme and morbid, but if I were to put someone 's spouse and someone 's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save? Maybe I just find that once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends, but when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more.

What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line.

{"input": "Progress in automation will eventually lead to a full fledge genocide on the majority of the population. 47 % of all jobs are at risk of being automated. This number will grow grow until the vast majority of people become obsolete for jobs. Since some of this automation will inevitably come to weapons, the wealthy will have the perfect opportunity to commit genocide on the 99 %. By fortifying themselves in their gated communities with rows upon rows of automated defences, all unburdened by humans with consciences and families, they can simply wait for everyone to starve or get killed while they bask in their machine generated wealth. Once everyone is dead, they can simply be wiped from history. You, me, everyone will have never existed. A crime completely erased. I am not the only one to predict this outcome ( see the last section on\" exterminism\"). I do n't think the other more optimistic futures expressed in that article will come to pass given current mentalities. I think it 's also too late to stop it. Those who will fight it will lose. You remember that old phrase from Forest Gump,\" a man only needs so much money, the rest is just for showing off.\" Well that 's actually quite true. Throughout history, people tend to use their wealth to show off how much wealth they have. The status symbols change over time, but the existence of status symbols does n't. There was a time, say in the 18th century, where the elite would wear quite elaborate clothing. Check out this picture of [ Louis XIV] ( http: //www.paradoxplace.com/Photo % 20Pages/France/FranceHistory/Images/Louis-XIV-BAR800.jpg). He 's dressing in elaborate, fantastical clothing to tell everyone,\" look how rich and powerful I am. I can afford to waste resources on immense amounts of expensive fabric.\" Nowadays, you would never see a wealthy leader dressing like this. Clothes have become cheap, thus they are no longer useful as a status symbol. Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth, but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart. His suit is just higher quality and better fitted. Or consider beauty standards. Back during the Victorian Era, it was very fashionable for women of class to have extremely pale skin. When most of the populace lived on farms or walked to work in a factory, most people got tan quite easily. Only the rich could afford to be pale. Nowadays, where most people work office jobs, retail jobs, food service, etc, tanning is a luxury good, a sign you have enough spare time to sit in the sun or money to go to a tanning salon. So, what would the luxury goods be for a post-scarcity society? In such a society, the cost of most physical goods would approach zero. Raw materials would be extracted by robots. Energy would come from cheap robot-produced solar farms. Robots would assemble and repair other robots. The cost of most physical goods, in a true post-scarcity society, is near zero. Sure, a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a 2015 Lexus, but what 's the point? Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIV 's outfit, but no one ever does. It 's just seen as silly and ridiculous, possibly even a sign of mental illness. So, what would rich people spend their money on? What are the status goods of post-scarcity society? Well, real estate could certainly be one. The cost to build a house may be zero, but land certainly is n't. Still, this can be ameliorated by high-rises. Lots of people can afford to live in a ritzy downtown area if a high-quality high rise can be built to next for nothing. Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their would n't. So, without that, what do we have? About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is human-intensive services. Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor? Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead. You *could* put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you 're better than that. Hire an expensive private tutor instead. You *could* have a robot do your hair or nails, but really? What are you, a common peasant? Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth. You *could* use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy. In short, in a world where the cost of physical goods is near zero, the only way to show off your wealth is to hire a bunch of people as a status symbol.
